I should have known I was in for a rough day when I woke up to rain. Not that rain is unusual, but I&#8217;d never seen it rain in Santa Monica before. It was a nice rain, though, the kind that you don&#8217;t mind walking to work in. After a weekend spent riding buses and enjoying the company of good friends (not that I&#8217;m complaining), I found myself in a deficit of spoons, though. If I were practical, I would have come back to the hotel right after work and gone straight to bed. Instead, I went for tea and wrote. A twitter conversation Friday night completely changed what I was planning to do for the 20spec anthology and I was eager to get started.
