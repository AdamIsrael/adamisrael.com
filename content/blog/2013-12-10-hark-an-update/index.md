Hark! Inconsistent blogger has returned with news!

I am pleased to announce that I&#8217;ve sold &#8220;Aye of the Hagfish&#8221; to [Goldfish Grimm&#8217;s Spicy Fiction Sushi](1). It should be appearing online early 2014. This will be my second appearance in the magazine (the first being [Control](2), in their debut issue).

I&#8217;m down to one story in circulation, and no new short stories finished this year, but for good reason! I finished the first draft, first read-through, and have begun developmental edits on the novel tentatively titled (but almost guaranteed to be renamed) &#8220;Black Mirror&#8221;.

We&#8217;re settling in for a long winter here at casa de Israel-Redman. The cupboards are stocked with tea, coffee, and non-perishable foodstuffs. Candles are lit, the fireplace channel is giving us the proper ambiance, and we&#8217;re getting busy with the making of art and stuff. Come spring, we&#8217;ll come out of our self-imposed hibernation with some fun new things to show off.
