On the heels of yesterdays post about [Booklife and my personal mission statement](1), I have added [My Booklife](2) to the sidebar. From here, I have posted and will keep updated my public [weekly](3), [monthly](4), [1 year](5) and [5 year](6) goals. I&#8217;ve also included my list of career [achievements](7).

I&#8217;m feeling pretty good about how things are shaping. I&#8217;m starting the year with a more or less clean slate; new domain, new blog, and new goals. That should help me keep track of things, in my special obsessive-compulsive sort of way.
