So, due to timing of [unfortunate circumstances](1), it&#8217;s become rather convenient for me to go to [Ad Astra](2), April 13-15th. This will, notably, be my first convention since moving to Canada.

I&#8217;m relatively new to both country and the local genre community. I know there are a few members of Codex going and I recognize a few names from the panelist listÂ (including Ed Greenwood, who was very kind towards a 19-year old me at Gen Con Milwaukee some years ago) but I&#8217;m otherwise winging this. I&#8217;m not exactly shy, but I&#8217;m not going to impose myself on people I don&#8217;t know, either.

Are you going? Please, say hi!
