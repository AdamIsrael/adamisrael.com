[<img class="size-medium wp-image-524 alignright" title="Crimson Pact" src="http://www.adamisrael.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/GargoylewBorder-205x300.jpg" alt="" width="205" height="300" />](1) I&#8217;m pleased to announce the sale of a flash fiction story, &#8220;History of the Flesh&#8221;, to volume 2 of The Crimson Pact anthology.

My story of a [psychometrist](2) turned [sineater](3) started almost two and a half years ago, during the Codex Weekend Warrior contest. For five consecutive weekends, we write a flash fiction inspired by one of three posted prompts and post it by the wee hours of Monday morning. The prompt I chose was:

> Imagine someone had an extra sense to perceive the physical world. How would it work and what would s/he do with it? Write a story about it.

I&#8217;d had the idea for a character who saw the history of things that he touched (and the personal toll such an ability would bring) in mind for a while and I&#8217;ve long been fascinated with things like sineaters. The story, from the same world as my novel-in-progress, snowballed from there.

The anthology will be available in August and will include stories by many other fine writers that I&#8217;m excited to share a Table of Contents with (details forthcoming).
