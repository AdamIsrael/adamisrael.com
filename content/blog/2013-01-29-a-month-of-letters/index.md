[Mary Robinette Kowal](2) started a delightful challenge, in 2010, to go correspond via letter for an entire month. That has grown to become [A Month of Letters](3), which runs for the whole of February. During the next month, I and the other 6,000 people who&#8217;ve signed up to participate will be writing letters, post cards, and doing other creative things and dropping them into the mail.

I love to write longhand, and this gives me a wonderful reason to do so. That&#8217;s where you come in. I&#8217;m looking for more people to write to &#8212; the more the merrier. If you would like to receive a genuine, hand-written letter from yours truly, send me your address. Email me, message me on [Twitter](4) or [Facebook](5), or use my [contact form](6).

This is an opportunity to rekindle friendships and make new ones, without the limitations of Twitter or the haste of email. Let&#8217;s write!
