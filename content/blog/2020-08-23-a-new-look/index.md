I was growing frustrated with my old website layout. It seemed like any time I went to write a post, I was breaking something in the theme. I'll admit that this was likely my own fault. To that end, I've switched from [Academic](https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/), which is a robust theme but more than I actually need, to [Hugo Future Imperfect Slim](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-future-imperfect-slim/). 

Hopefully this will spur me to post more often. There's lots of news and thoughts I'd like to share. Since my last post, I've changed jobs, written new stories, lost several pets, and then there's the whole 2020 pandemic.
