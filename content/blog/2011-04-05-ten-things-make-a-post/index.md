Yes, I still suck at blogging regularly. I don&#8217;t expect that&#8217;ll change, but I sure keep trying. So, to catch you up on the life of Adam, here&#8217;s a quick rundown of what I&#8217;ve been up to.

  * Achieved INBOX=0 and rocked the hell out of my calendar and TODO list. Yes, I might be micro-managing my time but it seems to be working. I&#8217;ve been more productive this last week than I have in the last few months, both personally and professionally.
  * I have a few pieces of very good news that I&#8217;ll be able to talk about next week. I am practically zinging off the walls, but I must wait until the ink is dry and no one can call take-backs on me.
  * Wrote [an introductory primer to the Clarion Workshops](1) for the [Inkpunks](2) blog. I&#8217;ve meant to write a sort of handbook for preparing for and surviving the Clarion experience. This is a start.
  * Revised another story for submission, bring the total to five stories in circulation. Mean average is 46 days out. Fire and forget.
  * Drowning in paperwork for immigration to Ontario. No red flags to hold things up, just lots of mostly well-meaning bureaucracy. Birth certificates, marriage certificates, divorce certificates, drops of blood, toe nail clippings from when I was six&#8230;
  * I&#8217;m one piece of paper away from being able to get an Ontario drivers license, which lets us get car insurance and, well, a car. It&#8217;ll be nice to take off and drive aimlessly, without worry of tying up the shared vehicle. Watch out, Toronto, I&#8217;ll be coming to see you.
  * I&#8217;m gathering my thoughts on first-hand impressions of universal healthcare vs. the mess we&#8217;ve got in the states. After witnessing what Andrea aptly described as &#8220;lung custard&#8221; being coughed up by a sick young girl in the emergency room yesterday, it&#8217;s safe to say that sick is sick no matter where you are and there&#8217;s always room for improvement in any large, monolithic system of control.
  * It is, as of this post, just 17 days and 20 hours from the world premier of season six of Doctor Who. I&#8217;ve rewatched season 5 in preparation and am now enjoying, for the first time, Torchwood.
  * Apparently the Canadian government resigned or was overthrown recently. I swear, I had nothing to do with it. I&#8217;m still trying to figure out the politics here. There are more political parties than actual politicians, I think.
  * I finally have an office chair for my cave in the basement. Now I just need the weather to warm up so I don&#8217;t freeze to death while working down there.
