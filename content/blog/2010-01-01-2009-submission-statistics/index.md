It wasn&#8217;t the best year writing-wise. Eight new stories, one of which was flash and four were &#8220;hint fiction&#8221;. Two stories from 2008 were edited repeatedly and eventually submitted, both to Writers of the Future. Fifteen submissions, thirteen rejections, and one rewrite request. If my Duotope statistics are accurate, nine were personal rejections (one from a pro market).

Could be worse. 2010 will be much better, though.
