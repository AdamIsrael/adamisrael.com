Sort of a post-Inkpunks post about where I'm at wrt writing, comparing with where some of my peers/clarion classmates/etc are at. The non-competitive feeling. The _zen_ of it all. And why it's okay -- necessary, even -- to write at your own pace.

Key points:

- Seeing Clarion classmates with short stories and novels, even award noms
- Inkpunk alumni kicking ass, writing novels, creating things
- Not feeling like I'm outputing "enough"
- Day jobs: day job + writing vs writing as a day job (and having to hustle harder to get by) and the risk to your art
- Finding balance
