I&#8217;ve owned one electric razor in my life. It didn&#8217;t do a great job of shaving my face and cleaning it out was a pain in the ass. I&#8217;ve been using a disposable instead (one of those three-razor things) but replacement blades are expensive and the entire process annoys me. I&#8217;m wondering if that electric razor I tried before just wasn&#8217;t that good? So, to try out this nifty polling plugin, a question! What do you use to shave? If there&#8217;s a particular brand you prefer, I&#8217;d appreciate a comment about what and why. It&#8217;s for a good cause; I&#8217;m tired of looking a teenage boy trying to grow a beard.
