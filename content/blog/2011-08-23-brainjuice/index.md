Can you believe I managed to blog three whole days in a row <del>last week</del> two weeks ago? Yeah.

Apparently I&#8217;m running in low power mode right now. New meds, a heavy work schedule, and two short story deadlines. Oh, and I&#8217;m outlining NOVEL.

I&#8217;ve got around twenty unfinished short stories in inventory. My plan is to revise a short story every month or so while drafting novel. I don&#8217;t plan to draft any new short stories until I&#8217;ve finished this novel draft, unless something new like [Shanghai Steam](1) comes along or a specific invite comes along that catches my interest. Shiny is shiny, after all.

How long will this take? Fuck if I know. I&#8217;ve never finished a novel before. When I&#8217;m drafting short stories I average 500 words/day with relative ease. I suspect I can double that but I&#8217;ll be conservative and give myself until my birthday next summer &#8212; almost exactly 11 months away. If I don&#8217;t have a complete draft by then, something is seriously wrong and the [Inkpunks](2) are formally invited to visit a beatdown on my ass.

Expect regular status updates complete with word widget and maybe even tiny extracts of out of context words that I&#8217;m not totally horrified by.
