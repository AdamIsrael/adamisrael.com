The Clarion Write-a-thon starts on June 24<sup>th</sup>, running parallel to the six week workshop I attended in 2010. While this summers workshop students toil away in San Diego, I’ll be one of many writers helping to raise awareness and solicit donations to a cause we believe in.

> What is a write-a-thon, anyway? It&#8217;s just like a walk-a-thon. But instead of walking, we&#8217;re writing, and instead of making pledges per mile, we&#8217;re making pledges per word, chapter, or story. Writers get support, encouragement and motivation, and the option of joining a team with a writing mentor! Those who care about the writers in their life get a way to show their support. And money is raised for a literally fantastic cause &#8212; the Clarion Science Fiction & Fantasy Writers&#8217; Workshop. All donations are made through The Clarion Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, EIN #20-3114945.

I’ll also be one of the aforementioned mentors this year, as part of Team Weaveworld. The teams are a new thing with the write-a-thon this year, as a way to provide support and motivation for those who want it.

During this years write-a-thon, I’ll be continuing work on my novel-in-progress. My challenge is to write at least 1,000 words/day, 5 days/week, with an ultimate goal of 30,0000 words over the six weeks.

I&#8217;d love to raise tons and tons of money for Clarion, because I passionately believe in what they do (and did for me). This is a no pressure pitch on my part, though. [Pledge](1) what you feel comfortable with, knowing that you have my utmost thanks and appreciation for donating to something dear to my heart.
