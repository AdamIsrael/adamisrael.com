When I kicked off the year writing 250 new words a day, I had a plan. A story. An _outline_, man. I finished that story yesterday. Plus an impromptu flash fiction piece. Today? I have no plan.

I have a theme (thank you, upcoming anthology). I have the kernel of a plot and main character. Tonight, I write without  my safety net. I&#8217;m curious to see what this change in process produces. With luck, I&#8217;ll end the night with a coherent idea of where this is going.
