Hello, folks, this is your captain speaking. We&#8217;ve reached the halfway mark in our journey to noveldom. There&#8217;s been some minor turbulence along the way but we&#8217;re in blue skies now.

Almost.

In this hot mess of first draft spagetti and a generous serving of cheese, I&#8217;m learning a lot. One being that I&#8217;m frighteningly close to the climax of the story and that the later part of the month will see me going back through and filling in things that I skipped over. Subplots and minor characters left off-screen need care and attention, because they are interesting and still trapped inside my head.

The other thing that I&#8217;ve done poorly is setting. I think it&#8217;s true of most stories, but especially so of Urban Fantasy, is that setting is character and, as characters go, I&#8217;ve made mine pretty bland so far. A large part of that was the lack of preparation. I wish I had a nice big map of the city printed out and tiled over my desk, with sticky notes to visualize this world like a giant pastel event wheel.

Lastly, I&#8217;ll be continuing with the reverse outlining as I go, straightening out my chapters and weaving together my various points of view. I swore off any rewriting or deleting during Nano but there are new scenes I&#8217;ve discovered through this process. I&#8217;ve had that panicked moment realizing that I was nearing the end as far as chapters go, but one saving grace for writing this out of order is that there are still plenty of words left to write.
