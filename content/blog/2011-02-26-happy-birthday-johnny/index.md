I missed seeing the last time you performed in Chicago. A client offered me tickets to see you and I scoffed. You, after all, were a country singer and I was too good for that; I&#8217;d rather listen to my heavy metal, thank you very much. So when I actually listened to your music for the first time, really listened, it was like you were speaking to me. I was hooked. By then, though, it was too late. You were gone.

You would have been 79 today. Even though you&#8217;re no longer with us, you continue to inspire. Happy birthday, [Johnny](2). You are missed.
