title: The doppelgänger effect

Yesterday was a travel day, coming home from a week in Breckenridge, CO for a work sprint. These are usually uneventful days, riding trains or shuttles to and from airports. Yesterday was different, though. Yesterday, I ran into my doppelgänger.

The first indication that something was off was when I checked my bag curbside. The porter asked me if I&#8217;d already checked a bag. I said no, and he gestured me to come around the counter and see what he was seeing. Sure enough, there was my name, showing one back checked.

I assumed it was because I&#8217;d checked-in online and paid the baggage fee, and said as much. We figured it was just some kind of oddity and carried on.

Grabbing a bite to eat inside the terminal, I noticed the second oddity. The boarding pass the porter handed me listed seat 6C, but the Delta app showed me in seat 18F. I thought maybe it was just a lag in my information being updated since arriving at the airport, but no. The app updated to show my gate information, but I was still in 18F.

At this point, I was pretty convinced that, despite the odds, there was another Adam Israel was on the flight; I had his bordering pass and he had my luggage.

Fast forward a couple hours (because we were there way early), I talk to the agent at the gate. She becomes apologetic very quickly, mentioning that this happened to her with a passenger last week as well, and confirms that I did have the wrong bordering pass. She makes sure that the other me&#8217;s final destination is the same as mine, and it is, so no luggage juggling has to be done.

Here&#8217;s the thing: I cleared security with someone else&#8217;s boarding pass. I had identification with my photo on it, but the boarding pass I presented wasn&#8217;t mine. Think about that. It&#8217;s a potentially serious lapse in security.

Everything worked out fine in the end. I saw (but didn&#8217;t get a chance to talk to) another Adam Israel. I got my luggage, and even caught a shuttle home three hours earlier than scheduled. I can&#8217;t help but wonder, though, what could happen if someone not as honest, with not so good intentions, could clear security at an airport simply by sharing a name with another passenger.
