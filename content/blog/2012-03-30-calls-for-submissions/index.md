_[Urban Green Man: An Archetype of Renewal](1)_, edited by Adria Laycraft & Janice Blaine, and to be published by [EDGE Science Fiction & Fantasy](2).

> The Green Man has haunted our churches and buildings and global subconscious for countless generations, becoming just another forgotten mythology that is relegated to garden statuary and English pub signs.
>
> No longer. Witness as the Green Man rises to capture our imagination in this anthology of original new fiction, the Urban Green Man.

I&#8217;m pretty excited by this anthology. I&#8217;m a huge fan of the Green Man mythos; I&#8217;m only sad that this own&#8217;t be my chance to rewrite my Green Man-on-a-generation-ship story. Still, I&#8217;m sure I will come up with something that keeps me awake at night.

_[Demeter’s Spicebox](3)_ is opening for their third issue. There are so many things that I love about their guidelines. They are inclusive, seeking diversity and setting out to explore lesser-known fairy tales from underutilized regions of the world, and that those stories must be done with some attempt at authenticity.

> The Third Issue of _Demeter’s Spicebox_ will continue the journey for the items from Mari Ness’s and Shveta Thakrar’s stories, but will also incorporate elements from [Joshua Gage](4)’s and [Mae Empson](5)’s stories from Issue Two. We invite brave writers who are willing to join this storytelling experiment and dialogue between tales. We would also like to encourage writers from diverse backgrounds to submit; _Demeter’s Spicebox_ is and always will remain a diversity-​​friendly venue. Our goal is to highlight voices that are strong, unique and brave. We pay attention to the strength of the story and to the strength of your voice as a writer.

There are additional requirements for issue three (see the guidelines for the full list) in order to connect these stories with the previously published ones.

Crossed Genres announced [Winter Well](6): an upcoming anthology of novellas featuring older women.

> We’re looking for speculative stories featuring women of advancing age (late middle age and older). They’re smart, they’re tough, and they have wills of their own.
>
> They may be warriors, politicians, adventurers, etc. Even if they are also wives, mothers, wise women or healers, those archetypes must not be their defining characteristics. Their motivations, their driving force, must be their own. Whatever was in their past, they’re not interested in being in the background now.
>
> We want stories about women breaking free of suppression; we also want stories of women who’ve been empowered all their lives.

CG does awesome work. They&#8217;ve published me before, and I support them whenever I can.
