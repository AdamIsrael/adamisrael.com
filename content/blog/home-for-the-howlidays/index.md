I'm a _bit_ late in announcing this, but I'm delighted to report that I sold a new story last year, to the anthology [Home for the Howlidays](https://tychebooks.com/howlidays).

> Celebrate the joys of togetherness during the holiday season with your friends, your family … and your pack. Let’s face it, whether you’re facing awkward family dinners, supernatural brawls, or the terrors of online dating, your pack always has your back.
