# From Container to Cloud: A DevOps Perspective

Talks are opinion pieces. Provide the audience with a little context on where you're coming from.


## Blurb
From Container to Cloud: A DevOps Attitude.

From independent developer to corporate code-slinger, we're eventually faced with the same problem: we've built something remarkable and now we have to deploy it to the nebulous thing known as production.

In this talk, I will show you how to use Linux Containers (LXD) to build and run applications securely, to scale from one to one thousand users, and to simulate the cloud, all on your laptop.

## TODO

Figure out a good app to demo, that can be charmed simply and quickly. It's not a Juju talk, just incidentally using Juju to do the job.

## When
Talk for the next software guild meeting in July

## The talk

Write code. Test locally. Deploy globally.

- LXD
- Public Clouds
- MAAS


Start out with containers (LXD). Build applications locally, but cloud-like, and deploy them to public clouds where they can be consumed by anyone.

- Show a CI/CD process w/Jenkins?
