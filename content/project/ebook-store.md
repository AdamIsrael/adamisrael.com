The idea for the ebook store was born out of frustration when I had a few magazine subscription's expire without notice.

I discovered how many small presses are labors of love. They are often small groups of dedicated folks whose time is stretched thin.

Over the past few years, I've been running the custom-built ebook store for Lightspeed Magazine, Fantasy Magazine, Nightmare Magazine, <a href="http://lamplightmagazine.com/">Lamplight Magazine</a>, and Fireside Magazine (before they moved to Patreon).

There is a new version of the ebook store in the works. Stay tuned for more details!
