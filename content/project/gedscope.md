GEDScope is a new project that's goal is to provide a toolkit for doing better search and analysis of genealogical data, inspired by the idea of using a microscope for the fine details.

The data contained within a GEDCOM file -- the de facto specification for exchanging genealogical data between different genealogy software -- contains very useful information that is under-utilized. To that end, I intend to build this library, and a companion website, to allow researches to:

- View a confidence rating of an individual.
- Find individuals by date of birth or death, or occupation, or location.
- Generate a heat map to show the migration of ancestors.
- Analyze variations in the surnames of a line of descendants.

That's just a few of the ideas. The project is very young, but you can find the project on <a href="https://github.com/AdamIsrael/gedscope">Github</a>, where you can contribute code or just ideas for what you'd like to see in a tool like this.
