# abstract: The beginning of the end started on 22 July, 1899. I stood outside my laboratory
#   atop Pikes Peak, near Colorado Springs. The frequent electrical storms the area
#   was known for made this an ideal location to carry out my research. Forks of lightning
#   danced across the sky and thunder crashed in the distance as a storm front approached.
#   The system moved swifter than I expected and soon small drops of rain pelted my
#   face. Inside, my devoted assistant Czito prepared the equipment. Previous experiments
#   proved the existence of stationary waves and now it was time to test my theory that
#   energy could be transmitted wirelessly. Tonight, the world would be changed forever.
