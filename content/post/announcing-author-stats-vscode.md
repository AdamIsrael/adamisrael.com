## Announcement

I'm happy to announce the first release of `Author Stats`, a [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension that makes it easier for authors to write Markdown by providing running statistics for their work.

This 1.0 release supports the count of visible versus total words. This might not seem like a huge deal, but for those of us outliners, we tend to fill our work with comment blocks.

## Future features

There's a few more planned features in the works:
- Reading time: calculates how long the work will take to read
- Per-session word count

## Getting it
