I had a [Finishing Things Weekend][1], joined by many friends on Twitter. I almost failed miserably. I finished none of the three things I&#8217;d planned on, instead crashing into a fibro-induced sleep state. Spending half of a weekend asleep and the other half wishing I were wasn&#8217;t what I had in mind, but I did salvage something from it.

After another nap, I checked my Duotrope stats. Saw a nifty new feature that let me search for markets I hadn&#8217;t submitted a story to yet. Found a market that might fit, submitted. Searched again, rinse and repeat. Completed the trifecta when I found an ebook anthology fitting a story I wrote two years ago that was a bit of a narrow fit but may work for their needs. So, three stories out in the world. I almost feel like a writer again.
