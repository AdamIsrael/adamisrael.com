I thought it&#8217;d be interesting to look at some rough numbers, based on my Duotrope stats, year over year.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">2010</span>

13 submissions to 10 different markets

4 stories on submission

13 rejections, 5 personal (38%)

10 markets

0 acceptances

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">2011</span>

43 submissions to 36 different markets

11 stories on submission

39 rejections, 16 personal (41%)

4 [acceptances](1)

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Misc. Stats</span>

Each year saw one story pulled from circulation after one submission (one was a reprint from 2008)

All four sales this year were made on the first submission (one by invitation)

It&#8217;s clearly a positive trend, and one I hope to continue into 2012. I don&#8217;t make resolutions, but I do set goals. This year, I&#8217;ll be finishing the novel I started last November and writing (and more importantly, finishing) a lot more short stories.
