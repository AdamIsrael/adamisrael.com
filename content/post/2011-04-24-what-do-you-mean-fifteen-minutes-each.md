I missed a couple days of writing last week, which included a day spent trying to get fingerprints taken for immigration and ended up with an appointment one week out. Who knew that fingerprint technology had advanced beyond ink pads? One set for Ontario, and a set each for the FBI and State of Illinois to request my records. The saga, she continues.

My Illinois driving records have been received by Mom and will soon be on their way here. Soon, I&#8217;ll be able to get an Ontario drivers license and then we can start the car shopping. I&#8217;m researching the Ford Focus, Mazda 3 hatchback, and the Dodge Caliber. A nice compact with good gas milage should do us well.

Two and a half scenes to go. I&#8217;ll wrap this draft in a few days and get hustling on the first revision. Between now and May 15th, when it&#8217;s due, I&#8217;ll end up with three or four revised drafts. There&#8217;s good guts in this here story. I just need to tease them out and make them pretty.
