Part of my new and improved resolve to Finish Things is accountability, and to that end I&#8217;ve created a master spreadsheet for the year where I&#8217;m tracking my daily writing, good things that happen (h/t Christie Yant), projects I want to work on, and deadlines I&#8217;m working towards. It&#8217;s not perfect, but it&#8217;s a start.

I&#8217;m trying to work every day while I&#8217;m involved in a project. Writing is, or should be, what I spend the most time on, at least at this stage in my current WIP. The non-writing tasks, like research, outlining, etc, are limited to what&#8217;s necessary to finish the draft. Research is my way to procrastinate. I did a ton before I started writing, I&#8217;ll do more after the first draft is finished, but at some point I actually have to write this thing.

I don&#8217;t want to take away time from writing, so I&#8217;m allowing myself to spam the world with statistics once a week.

It&#8217;s too soon since I started tracking daily stats to say if I&#8217;m going to hit my deadline or not. This first week has sort of been the warm-up, shaking off the rust of not writing at all for a couple months. I started at 364 days, no words one day (but outlining a new chapter), and ended today at 845. I think I&#8217;ll settle at a comfortable, consistent pace. There&#8217;s wiggle room in my deadline, but not much. My end goal, as soon as the first draft is done, is to revise and have a draft ready for submission by my birthday in late July.
