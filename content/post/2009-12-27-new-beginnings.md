I&#8217;ve been posting under the nom de plume &#8220;Stone Table&#8221; for the better part of fifteen years. As my writing career begins to bloom I&#8217;ve realized that a more professional web presence would be prudent. Not that I have a problem with my moniker but having to introduce myself as an inanimate object at conventions in order to be recognized as that guy from the Internet is kind of awkward and not the kind of impression I want to leave with people. More so when you want to be recognized as a peer and professional. So, after years of regrets followed by nail-biting, I am happy to announce that [AdamIsrael.com](1) is now mine.

From this point forward, I will be blogging under my own name. The [stonetable.org](2) domain will remain online for archival purposes and I will be phasing out my other uses of my nickname. Change is always uncertain but I&#8217;m excited by what&#8217;s to come.
