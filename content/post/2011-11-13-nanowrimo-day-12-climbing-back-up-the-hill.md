Good progress today, making up for last week&#8217;s shortfall. Making bullet point outlines of character/plot has been useful in figuring out some pacing/plot arc issues and giving me things to write that I hadn&#8217;t even realized I needed. I&#8217;ll need to do a massive reverse outline come December, though. Stitching the various plots and subplots together will take some work and much rewriting.

Day 13 begins anew with a writing date with my sweetheart. We&#8217;re off to breakfast, followed by the coffee shop for tea and words.
