A little bit of a rocky week, especially Friday. Ideally, I&#8217;d like to average 1,000 words/day. That&#8217;d be awesome. Life creeps up, with unavoidable things like responsibility and sleep but I have a secret that I&#8217;ll share with you. Lean a little close. That&#8217;s it, just a little closer.

It&#8217;s a little maddening to miss your goals. I live by my TODO list and I hate leaving things unfinished at the end of the day. You can&#8217;t beat yourself up over it, though. Make adjustments, if it&#8217;s a chronic problem (like overcommitment). In the end, though, it comes down to one thing:

**Sponsors**

Thank you, thank you, thank you. Several of you have made [donations][1] totaling $175 dollars, blowing away my personal expectations for fundraising for Clarion.

**Statistics**

I know Scrivener Fu. And I use Project Targets like a boss. I fell short on my word count last week but I know exactly what I need to do to stay on target. Week two is already ahead of schedule:

Overall, I&#8217;m quite happy with the way things are going. I&#8217;ve been doing a fair amount of revising, which is slowing things down a little bit but it needs to be done, especially if I want to start tormenting beta readers with a draft of this monster later this year.
