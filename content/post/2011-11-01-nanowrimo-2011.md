Today is November 1st, the start of a new [NaNoWriMo](1). I&#8217;ve been doing, or trying to do, NaNoWriMo, on and off unsuccessfully since 2002 when [my efforts](2) netted about 4,500 words.

Timing is a bitch. After I start writing seriously in 2007, I intended to do Nano that year. That November, a few days into the month, my marriage split up. The following November was the official divorce. A few slim years later, it preceded bankruptcy. Last year, it was an international move. So when the calendar flips over to November, it&#8217;s fair to say I get a little nervous and start looking to the sky for bad omens.

The world is still spinning. The sky hasn&#8217;t falling. I guess that means I&#8217;m in. I&#8217;ve plotted and like a Cylon, I have a plan. I&#8217;ve outlined and have stacks of research laying around my office. I know how this story ends. I know what I want to get out of Nano &#8212; not a 50k novel, but a 50k word start to a planned 120k word novel, with the work to continue into December and January to see that happen.

This novel in the same world as that novel I started in 2007, although the what and how has changed almost as much as I have since then. I&#8217;ve written short stories set in this world &#8212; one of them has been published (History of the Flesh, in the [Crimson Pact 2](3) anthology).
