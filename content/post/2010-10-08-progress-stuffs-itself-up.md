This cold/sinus/allergy thing that&#8217;s been sneaking its way into my head has finally arrived, triggering a slight fibro flare and a pretty good ear infection to boot. That cut my writing time short tonight and ended with me foggy enough that I left the drug store with cough medicine, not the cough and cold I meant to pick up.

Project: Tantric sex/magic story, now with more poly love, a plump dominatrix, and a Chicago swinger&#8217;s club.

New words written: 408

Reason for stopping: Out of spoons and Kleenex

Thought for today: [Cheryl Morgan spent last evening at a reading by William Gibson](2) and the follow-up Q&A. It&#8217;s a good summary of the session with Gibson and you should read it in its entirety. One thing stood out to me, personally:

> Much of the questioning concerned Gibson’s writing career and his development as a writer. He talked honestly about how young men tend to write books that feature things like zombie plagues and post-apocalyptic wastelands because they lack the experience of life to write well about people.

This was a discussion had at Clarion more than a few times, about age and experience. I envy those who discover and embrace their talents when they&#8217;re younger. It&#8217;s easy to lament coming into your own as a writer later in life and feeling like you have wasted time and opportunity.

We write in a vacuum but we shouldn&#8217;t live inside one, too. To me, writing is about examining the human condition and you need to experience it in order to do so. I may not have spent my formative adult years writing like I&#8217;d once dreamed but I have no regrets for that anymore. What I&#8217;m left with is are tools far more valuable to me. Wisdom, maybe. Experience, certainly. Depth of character, hopefully. All things, eventually, that will be reflected in my work.
