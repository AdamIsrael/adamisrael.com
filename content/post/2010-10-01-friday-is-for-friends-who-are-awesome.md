Happy fifth birthday to [Hadley Rille Books][1], who published my first [in print][2] story. They publish many fine books and anthologies, so please consider supporting this great small press.

Today is release day for [Rigor Amortis][3], edited by [Jaym Gates][4] and [Erika Holt][5], and containing stories by [R. Schuyler Devin][6], [Kaolin Imago Fire][7], [Kay T. Holt][8], [John Nakamura Remy][9], [Andrew Penn Romine][10], [Wendy N. Wagner][11], and many others.

This first of October 2010 also marks the launch of [Inkpunks][12], a group blog by some of the brightest up and coming writers and editors in speculative fiction. Every Tuesday and Friday there will be a post related to the writing. Disclaimer: I am one of the contributors.

Congratulations to my friend [John][13], who just completed [30 days as a Vegan][14]. Changing diet and lifestyle is harder than you might expect. Kudos to him for seeing it through. I&#8217;m looking forward to his final thoughts on the experiment.
