NaNoWriMo is over. I failed to win. I failed, but there are lessons in failure.

I set out to do a few things aside from writing 50k words. I wanted to learn to turn off my internal editor when I needed to, so that I could write first drafts on the computer. I wanted to write something longer than I&#8217;d written before, previously around 6,000 words. I wanted to get a better understanding of novel structure. Those things, I succeeded at.

In the end, my efforts stalled around Thanksgiving. I was at 28,264 words and I realized that I would need almost 4,000 words/day in order to hit the 50k mark and that wasn&#8217;t going to happen without some kind of herculean effort that, frankly, wasn&#8217;t worth the payout. I&#8217;d already done what I set out to do.

I blogged quite a few of my observations through the month. Mostly, they had to do with novel structure. That&#8217;s my biggest takeaway. For all of the novels I&#8217;ve read, the thing I&#8217;ve thought the least about (consciously) is structure. I used to think that the difference between short stories and novels was simply chapters being collections of scenes but it&#8217;s a bit more complicated than that.

What I wrote was, in many ways, a very detailed outline. It helped me flesh out plot and structure and characters. I figured out flaws in the story I had in my head and discovered some really cool things lurking in the shadows.

My next steps are doing a reverse outline of what I wrote. Chapters are out of order, pacing is a jumble, key scenes are missing, and there&#8217;s still 80k words to be written.

I personally find it difficult to write when I know a story isn&#8217;t working. I averaged almost 1,500 words/day, which was better than I do longhand but the quality suffered. It left me with another failed attempt at NaNoWriMo, but I feel better about this effort than any of the previous. Fail or not, I&#8217;m better for having tried.
