Week 4 ended on a bit of a downer. I&#8217;d been doing well, writing a bit each day but the streak came to an end. I drafted two short stories and three flash fiction. I started a fourth but it wasn&#8217;t ready to be told. Instead of forcing it, I skipped a day.

Somewhere along the way, I caught a nice little cold/flu, was diagnosed with some vitamin deficiencies (insert scurvy joke here, matey) and started a few new prescribed drugs. Needless to say, it&#8217;s taken a toll on my energy levels. Falling asleep at 9pm and sleeping for 11 hours is definitely not what I would call my normal. Hopefully the worst of this will pass in a few days.

My goals throughout February are slightly changed (I&#8217;ll update my goals list when I have more energy). So named by Andrea, February is now **T**ype **E**dit **P**olish **S**ubmit (TEPS) month. Type up draft zero and whip it into shape, clean it up, and send it to market. This should be good practice for me. Writing first drafts is easy; I have twenty of them in that state. Editing is the hard work and the thing I need the most work at.
