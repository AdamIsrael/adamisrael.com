A mostly solid day of writing. Andrea and I went out to the coffee shop for a morning session. I struggled with the words. Came home and napped.

Woke and procrastinated until the late evening and then&#8230;something broke open. Next thing I knew, I was over 2,000 words and it was almost midnight. I&#8217;m not saying they&#8217;re great words. Hell, some of them ain&#8217;t even good words. They&#8217;re my words, though, and I&#8217;m keeping them.

Project: Black Mirror
  
New words written: 2,184
  
Reason for stopping: Midnight

Something one of my Clarion teachers said keeps coming back to me as I write, and that was that the first draft of his novels were more detailed outlines than fully fleshed out drafts. When I&#8217;m picking up speed through this draft, I find that I&#8217;ve slipped into more of a detailed draft mode and my tense shifts from past to present. 

I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a bad thing. This is a rough draft. It&#8217;s a learning draft, even if I end up throwing everything out and starting over when the month is over (which I doubt will happen).

Milestones, which I alluded to, were broken today. Two of them. First, this is the longest I&#8217;ve stayed in Nanowrimo since I started attempting it. I can hear the voice of Gold Five in my head every morning when I wake up, telling me to stay on target, and I will. Second, I broke 8k words on a single piece of fiction. My longest single story previous is my time traveling Tesla alt. history that clocked in just under 7k in rough draft.
