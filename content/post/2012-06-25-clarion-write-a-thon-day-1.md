The [Clarion Write-a-thon][1] began yesterday. I got some decent writing time in, despite a late start to the day and having to confront a would-be pervert attempting to flash his private bits at my favorite writing spot. I expect the first several days of writing to go slow as I revise the first chapter of the novel, trying to set the right tone and pace. The 25k words I wrote during last year&#8217;s Nanowrimo are, I realize, mostly outline but do span the length of the novel. My task now is to fill in the gaps where I rush through sections I was unsure of and take my time getting through the rest. Also, sub-plot. I have it and now I need to make it work.

My pre write-a-thon novel stats:

After the first day&#8217;s session, which saw me revise most of chapter one, scene one:

A good start. I don&#8217;t feel at all nervous about my goals like I did during Nanowrimo. 30k words over six weeks is a little more reasonable for me, yes, but I&#8217;ve also spent more time thinking through this story and figuring out its structure. I&#8217;m definitely more of an outliner when it comes to novels, and the extra time I&#8217;ve spent in planning is paying off now.
