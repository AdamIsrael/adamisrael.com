I am delighted &#8212; tickled, in fact &#8212; to report that as of last Monday I am employed by [Canonical](1), the company behind [Ubuntu](2) Linux.

I&#8217;ve joined the Ecosystem Engineering team, part of Cloud Development and Operations, as a software engineer. More specifically, I&#8217;m working on [Juju](3), the cloud orchestration tool chain. I&#8217;ll be writing [charms](4) and documentation, working on optimizations, and helping to make a cool product even cooler.
