Yesterday was another low day, both in mood and writing. My daily target is creeping up slightly, to 1,932 words. Still within reason but I&#8217;m not happy about the lack of progress the last few days.

Mostly, this comes down to November being November, and my inexperience writing at this length. This shake down cruise is not without its bumps.

At the same time, short fiction continues, albeit at a slower pace. A rare paper submission came back in the mail today, marking my second to F&SF in four years. I&#8217;m kind of kicking myself for not submitting there more, considering that their response time is quicker than most electronic markets. That story still go back out on submission today, and I have two others that I need to find markets for but I&#8217;ve been procrastinating

I&#8217;ll likely spend part of my December recuperating from Nano by revising some short stories. I have one new one that I&#8217;d like to get out to market by year end.

Also, the &#8216;t&#8217; key on my keyboard is popping off the hinge, so I may be performing emergency surgery on the laptop soon. Sadness.
