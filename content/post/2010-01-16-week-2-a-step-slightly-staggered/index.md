A new short story and a flash fiction drafted, and a second short story underway. Over 7,500 new words this year, with my average rising to 509 words/day.Â  The [Honorable Mention](1) nod and a personal rejection also came in. The year is off to a good start.

I&#8217;m still struggling with revisions. I failed my weekly goals this week, getting almost no editing done nor my outline for the Dollhouse essay. The essay contest&#8217;s deadline has been extended by two weeks, so I&#8217;ve adjusted my goals to reflect that. What I think I need to do is set more specific revision goals. A page a day, maybe. I do well when I&#8217;m working against a deadline but I have way too many stories sitting neglected that don&#8217;t have a hard stop against them. I&#8217;m never going to get more submissions out the door if I don&#8217;t start revising on a regular basis.
