I feel like I&#8217;ve been at a near standstill the last four days. With one zero day among them, I&#8217;ve barely scratched a thousand words among them. To make up for the shortfall, I need to write roughly 2,400 words/day though the rest of the month in order to hit the Nano goal of 50k. I&#8217;ve hit that number once this month.

It&#8217;s going to be a nail biter.

It hasn&#8217;t all been wasted time. I&#8217;ve talked about how my pacing has been a problem. I&#8217;ve been stopping to make notes about missing scenes, characters, and plot arcs that I&#8217;ll need to work on post-Nano (or if I run out of story to write during). I&#8217;ve also been filling out character sheets as I go. I&#8217;ll need to do more of this as I reverse outline in December, making sure I have consistent details on everyone, if they&#8217;re a point of view character, and enough background to know who they really are.

I&#8217;m not going to throw in the towel, but I sure wouldn&#8217;t mind a day or two of really good output to give me a little buffer, ya know?
