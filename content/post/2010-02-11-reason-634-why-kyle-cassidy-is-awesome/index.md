Not only is Kyle Cassidy a heck of a photographer, writer and teacher, he is also one hell of a nice guy. I had a lucky chance to meet and learn a few photography skills some months back. He learned that I was also a writer and offered to send me one of his extra fountain pens. I very nearly squeed.

I&#8217;ve been interested in fountain pens for as long as I can remember. When I was young I used some cheap, cartridge-filled pens on occasion but fell out of habit as I aged. I always admired fountain pens from afar, and lived vicariously through my friend [Dierdre](1) and her pen obsession. That pen from Kyle, an old Arnold sitting on the bladder transplant list, resparked that old passion. This past Christmas I received brethren to join my collection.

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-199" title="How I write" src="http://www.adamisrael.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/DSC_7228-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" srcset="//www.adamisrael.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/DSC_7228-300x199.jpg 300w, //www.adamisrael.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/DSC_7228.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](2)

The awesome Kyle is [running a contest](3) on his blog and the lucky winners will also receive a nifty fountain pen that is in need of love and affection. Go there. Make a semi-anonymous post with a picture of your notebooks, assuming you&#8217;re like us and write longhand, as well as a small writing sample &#8211; a poem, a paragraph, a snappy retort, whatever.
