Yesterday was the fourteenth day of Nano and I haven&#8217;t missed a one. I feel pretty good about that, no matter what else happens. I crossed the 20k mark, which feels _awesome_.

I am beginning to grok this pacing thing. Fires are smoldering inside my cranium. You can read about this, talk about this, but there is no substitute for doing.

I&#8217;m facing down the fact that today is the mid-month mark and I should be 5k ahead of where I am by days end to be at parity. That&#8217;s a little sobering, but the marathon continues apace. I procrastinated yesterday by cleaning and reorganizing my workspace a bit. Not strictly necessary but better workspace == better headspace.
