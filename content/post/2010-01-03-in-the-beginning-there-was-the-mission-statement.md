I am horrible with deadlines. In high school I was forced to take a special class on time management because I never turned anything in on time. It&#8217;s one of those things that I struggle with on a daily basis. Occasionally I discover something useful that helps, like [Things](1), that help me keep track of the things I need to be doing. The most recent one was [Jeff VanderMeer](2)&#8216;s [Booklife](3).

I picked up a copy sometime in December. Sat down, started reading, and couldn&#8217;t put it down. When I finally relented, the next thing I did was tell my friend [Christie](4) that she had to [stop everything](5) she was doing and start reading her copy.

It might be a bold claim to say that this book changed my life, but it&#8217;s true. The book is subtitled &#8220;strategies and survival tips for the 21st-century writer&#8221; and that&#8217;s true, but it&#8217;s so much more. It changed the way I looked at my public identity. It prompted me consider exactly what my short and long-term goals were, and what my end goal for writing is. Most importantly, it provided me with some tools to accomplish what I struggle with the most.

The book covers everything from planning to social networking to public relations. For my purposes, I&#8217;ve read and reread the section on creating and managing goals several times because it most directly addresses my most chronic weakness. As a result, I&#8217;ve written several things to help manage my time and my career.

**The Mission Statement, or, what the hell am I doing here?**

> I want to write the best stories that I can, and continually challenge myself to grow creatively. I believe fiction should be as diverse as the real world and that should be represented in my work. I want to earn the respected member of the SFF community that I love through my words and my actions. I will continue to [pay it forward](6), to give and share what I can, for the betterment of us all.

This serves as a reminder to me of what it is I&#8217;m trying to accomplish in my life and my work. As I writer, I want to create damned good stories that make people think or laugh or cry, or just give them the escape they need to survive. As a person, I want to leave things better than I found them. That means sharing my knowledge and speaking out when I have something worth saying.

I&#8217;m also a firm believer in public accountability. As such, I plan to blog regularly about my process, success or failure. I&#8217;ve put together and will be posting, based on the advice in Booklife, one year and five year goals. Goals, by my definition, are things achievable directly by my own actions. I can&#8217;t control if an editor likes and wants to publish my work but I can control how many stories I write, edit, and submit.

Additionally, I&#8217;ve begun building a list of career achievements, like seeing my name in print in a bookstore, which I recently did, or being invited to a convention. These things mark milestones in a writers career and I think it&#8217;s interesting to keep track of.

I&#8217;ve been bad about over-committing myself and that needs to stop. I work more than full-time. I write. I read slush. I critique. Those are things I enjoy doing. Beyond that, I&#8217;m going to have to be selective about what else I do for others beyond the scope of my mission statement above. I have some outstanding projects that I committed to that will be finished. After that, I have to focus on what&#8217;s important to me.

So, if you&#8217;re a writer and you haven&#8217;t read Booklife yet, I can&#8217;t recommend it enough. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you write short or long, or if you&#8217;ve only been writing a short time. Out of all of the books aimed at writers that I&#8217;ve read it is easily the best of them and well worth the investment.
