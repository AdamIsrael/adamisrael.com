Winter, as they say, is coming and appropriately enough, I celebrated it with a London Fog Latte (Earl Grey tea, a shot of vanilla, and steamed milk).

Not my best work here, but I laid out the bones of what needs to be done. A hot mess of potential awesome might be the best way to describe it all. I started organizing my notes for a post-Nano reverse outline. In keeping with the spirit of Nano, no words will be deleted no matter how much my inner editor cringes.

Project: Black Mirror

New words written: 1,738

Reason for stopping: Coffee shop closing

When this is all over, I&#8217;ll be curious to read the blogs of/talk to other authors I know doing Nano and see what their experiences are. I know I&#8217;m essentially brute-forcing my way through a very extensive outline, but that was one of my expectations so I&#8217;m okay with it.
