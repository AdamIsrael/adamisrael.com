I felt a little blue this week, grousing over revisions and my sometimes fragile ego. I distracted myself by patiently refreshing the Writers of the Future blog and checking the mail every few minutes, hoping to see some word of the 2009 Q4 results. Well, the [list of Honorable Mentions](1) was released before they had a chance to [update the blog](2).

> &#8220;Out of the thousands of stories that get submitted to the contest, a small percentage make it this far,&#8221; Wentworth continued. &#8220;Past Honorable Mention stories have gone on to see publication elsewhere. That is how competitive this contest is. The contest quality of submissions is the best of the best.&#8221;

I am pretty pleased to see my name on the list of Honorable Mentions. It certainly shook me out of my funk. I&#8217;m one for one so far, so We&#8217;ll see if I can keep up the streak with my Q1 submission. Now to see if I can find a good home for the Q4 story.

As an aside, is there any benefit to adding &#8220;received Honorable Mention, Writers of the Future Q4 2009&#8221; to a stories cover letter? My guess is no, since a shiny rejection is still a rejection and not relevant to the new market.
