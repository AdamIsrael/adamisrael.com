I&#8217;ve always liked stories about mundane things. Everyday people who might be ignored or worse, shunned &#8212; garbage men, teachers, farmers, butchers, prostitutes, factory workers &#8212; who find themselves in extraordinary circumstance and rise up to the challenge.

The annals of history are filled with stories of the famous, the successful, the victors. Finding tales about those broke their backs to make a living is harder. It&#8217;s not glamorous work. No one does it to become rich or powerful. They&#8217;re born into it, forced into it, marginalized into it. Their stories deserve to be told, too.

There&#8217;s a reason why [Crossed Genres](2) is of my favorite small presses. They have a long history of supporting diversity in it&#8217;s many forms. Their latest project is [Long Hidden: Speculative Fiction From the Margins of History](3), and it could use your help. They&#8217;ve made their initial Kickstarter goal so the anthology, edited by Rose Fox (who I have tons and tons of respect for) and Daniel José Older (who I&#8217;m sure is equally awesome), but still have a bit to go for their stretch goals.

They are nearing the next goal, to add another 10 stories/50,000 words to the anthology. The bigger the book, the more diverse it will be. A no-brainer, right?

I think we can push it further. The third stretch goal will add original black & white art to every story, and if they make it to $50,000, the last stretch goal, they will produce a professional quality audio book.

I&#8217;m all too familiar with Kickstarter fatigue. I feel it myself. This one is from an established publisher; [Bart and Kay](4) have been around for a while and have a proven track record behind them. If you&#8217;re interested in the kind of stories they&#8217;re telling, please give them a look.
