November 1st is here and that means [NaNoWriMo](1) &#8211; National Novel Writing Month. As someone who is a short story writer, I often look at my friends writing the long form with some envy. They have their own month and I don&#8217;t want to be left out so I tell myself that I will finally write one of those novel ideas I&#8217;ve been noodling on for forever. Just when I think I&#8217;ve picked one and made a decision, the weight of  my backlog of revisions, rewrites, or markets I want to submit to smacks me like a brick. So, I&#8217;m doing [AlterNaNoWriMo](2).

The rules of AlterNaNoWriMo are simple:

  1. Just like the real NaNoWriMo, the work you&#8217;re rewarded for begins on November 1st and ends at midnight on November 30th but doesn&#8217;t have to be a novel, or even 50,000 words.
  2. Be accountable. Blog and/or tweet tweet (with the #alternano hash tag) your goal(s) your progress.

My goals:

  * Write every day
  * Weekly blog status updates
  * Daily twitter status updates
  * Draft a secret santa story
  * Draft, revise, & submit _<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Eye of the People</span>_ for 20spec
  * Draft, revise, & submit _<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tesla&#8217;s Daughter</span>_ for 20spec
  * Rewrite sineater/psychometry story
  * Rewrite gluttony story
  * Revise _<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Way Out is Through</span>_

I think I convinced a couple people to do #alternano with me this weekend, which was awesome and inspiring and deserves a post of its own, once I&#8217;ve had a chance to catch my breath.
