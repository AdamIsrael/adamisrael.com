I think I&#8217;m going to try blogging as I go &#8212; nothing extensive because I don&#8217;t want to take away from the real writing but I do want to jot down my thoughts. This is a process of learning and experimentation for me. I&#8217;ve been writing short stories seriously for four years but writing something novel-length is a different kind of beast.

One thing talked about on Twitter today was that some people actually start querying their Nano novels shortly after they&#8217;ve finished. In some cases, the day after. I can&#8217;t fathom this. I don&#8217;t submit things until I feel reasonable confident in them being, you know, readable. It&#8217;s rare that I write and submit a short story in the same month but a _novel_? Seriously? My original plan was to take a year to rewrite, revise, polish, and start to query agents. Given the flood of half-finished nano novels they get hit with between December and February, I&#8217;m thinking that I need to step up my game and aim for earlier next year &#8212; maybe by World Fantasy.

First drafts are rough. Making the transition between short story and novel, at least for the first time, is like riding in a rock tumbler. I planned, I outlined, and I may end up scrapping half of the structure I put in place. I know where I&#8217;m going but knowing how to put together chapter and scene in any coherent way is something learned better by doing on the fly, I suspect.

Pacing&#8230;yeah. I&#8217;m working on that.

Typing vs. writing longhand isn&#8217;t as bad as I remember. I did use [Freedom](1) to block my Internet for part of it, but then I wanted Google Maps for reference. I&#8217;m not sure if that was good or bad. I did finally manage to muffle my internal editor somewhat, which was my main goal for day one. I expect that to be an ongoing challenge until I find the right balance between useful editorial whispers and drafting speed.

Title: Black Mirror

Reason for stopping: hit midnight

Favorite line: “Do the little boys still miss their Mommy?” the demon mocked.

I didn&#8217;t get the word count I hoped for. I&#8217;m aiming for 2,000/day, with an final draft around 120,000 words sometime this January. I had a rocky start, just getting the scene and tone set right (a problem I have with every story) but then we had to take a little detour.

The kitten we found a few weeks ago became a less permanent part of our household. We decided that, until Andrea and I have a place of our own, we really don&#8217;t have the space for any more animals. Not an easy decision to make, especially for me, but an adult one. We drove the little girl up to a family friend this afternoon who has been catless for a little while and introduced the two of them. I think they made a good fit.

I&#8217;d forgotten how bad the emotional crash of fibro could be. By the time I got home I was in fit state; I skipped supper and slept for a few hours before squeezing in the rest of my words before midnight. Not quite my usual schedule but I don&#8217;t feel so bad going into tomorrow.
