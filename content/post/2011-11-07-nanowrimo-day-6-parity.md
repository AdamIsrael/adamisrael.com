Not as much writing as I&#8217;d like today, mostly my own fault. When I actually sit down to write, I can knock out the words but today I procrastinated and was easily distracted. Still, I managed to hit parity with the Nano model of 1,667 words/day.

Project: Black Mirror
  
New words written: 1,975
  
Reason for stopping: Midnight

Almost a week in to this draft, I still feel pretty good about it. I haven&#8217;t had that &#8220;OMG OMG we&#8217;re all going to die&#8221; feeling _once_. The ideas are solid and the writing can be fixed. This is a story that I would pick up and read. That&#8217;s probably a good thing, because I&#8217;m going to spend a significant amount of time in this world between now and next summer, getting it ready for someone other than me to read.
