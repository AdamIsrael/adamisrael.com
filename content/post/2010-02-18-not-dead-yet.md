My mom had reconstructive ankle surgery to correct some of long-term damage caused by polio so I spent the last few weeks with her, doing laundry and cooking and whatnot. I also took the opportunity to wear down my annual deductible and get a few lingering medical issues looked at. And while in Illinois, I picked up a rather nasty flu that has wiped me out completely.

Most of the effects of the flu are gone, knock on wood. My energy seems to be the last thing to return. I&#8217;ve been regularly sleeping 10-12 hours/day, which is a far cry from my usual 6-7. It&#8217;s cut into my writing time severely, including updates here and on twitter. I suspect I&#8217;ll be back to normal in a few more days and will be back to work on things. End of month deadlines that must be met, flu or no flu.
