I was recently asked about what [Atom](https://atom.io/) packages I use, and I thought it'd be good to document it. These are the most used of the 38 Community Packages I've installed.

| Package                 | Notes |
|-------------------------|-------|
| MagicPython             | Syntax highlighter for Python
| atom-beautify           | Make code pretty
| auto-detect-indentation | Auto-detect file indentation and set editor to match.
| autocomplete-python     | Auto-complete packages, variables, methods, etc.
| autocomplete-webpack    | ^^ the same, but for Webpack
| git-plus                | Git integration. Used mainly to see git state (branch and changed files).
| go-plus                 | A must for Golang development. Helps enforce best practices (lint, tests, etc).
| language-babel          | Syntax highlighting for Babel
| language-yang           | Syntax highlighting for Yang
| linter-flake8           | Linter plugin for Python, using flake8
| linter-js-yaml          | Linter plugin for JS and Yaml files
| linter-pep8             | Linter plugin for Python, using pep8
| linter-python-pep8      | Yet another Linter plugin for Python using pep8. I don't remember why I'm using both.
| linter-tidy             | Linter plugin for HTML, using tidy.
| pretty-json             | Make JSON pretty and human-readble
| sort-lines              | Sort lines. Good when dealing with text files, but I miss Textmate's ability to cat files to external commands, i.e., sort, sed, and awk.
| teletype                | Nifty way to do paired programming
| tree-view-sort          | Sort the tree view
| wordcount               | Handy for writing blog posts and other docs.
