Guess what? I feel better. Better than I have in five years or so. What changed? Interesting, that&#8230;

A couple weeks ago, I decided to do a reboot of the diet. My reading on [Fibromyalgia](1) led me to discussions of [Celiac disease](2) and how much of an overlap there is between the two. I figured that going back to a basic diet of protein, vegetable, and fruit for a week or two would be a good reset. What I didn’t expect was how much different I would feel.

The pain in my knee went away almost entirely. The fatigue went from being a daily battle is now just an occasional struggle. Instead of sleeping six fitful hours I’m now down for nine and feeling well-rested. The cognitive issues &#8212; difficulty concentrating and remembering &#8212; have improved drastically. My GI issues have also made a very welcome change for the better.

Maybe it’s not Fibromyalgia after all. Maybe it’s a combination of the two. Lupus still hasn’t officially been ruled out but I should find that out Thursday. In any case, I feel better and that’s what counts. I’ve re-introduced everything but gluten in my diet and I still feel good. The one day I did try eating gluten, well, let’s just say it wasn’t a fun day. I’m relatively sure we’re no longer on speaking terms. The only problem is that diagnosing Celiac usually requires you to be on a gluten-rich diet and, uh, hell no.

Now that my brain is getting back to normal, I’m finding that I am far behind where I’d like to be in pretty much everything. Clarion’s coming up quickly so I’m finishing what I can now and you can be sure that there will be much ass kicking and fixing of things once I return.
