I&#8217;ve been slogging away, the last few weeks, trying to string together words that make sense. It&#8217;s been rough. A nameless ennui that I blame on not having a place to personalize yet. That&#8217;s something Andrea and I will be working towards in the new year. Meanwhile, life goes on and the writing must continue so I had to find a way.Â Deadlines usually help, but I&#8217;ve been staring two or three, maybe four, up the ugly side so much lately that I&#8217;m beginning to go cross-eyed.

This past week, I simply used a calendar to block out my time to write or work or even eat. That&#8217;s taken me from fretting over my non-existent progress to putting my butt in the chair and editing for seven and a half hours over the past three days. Not only did I finish a revision of my Tesla&#8217;s Daughter story, but I know just how long I spent working on it and I have a real sense of accomplishment for turning around what was feeling like a serious nose dive in the confidence department.

Now, if only my beta readers have some kind, constructive words (hint, hint). I have three days to get this polished up and submitted. Nothing like cutting it close to the wire.
