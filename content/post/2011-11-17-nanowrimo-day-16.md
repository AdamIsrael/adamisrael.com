I found my stride yesterday, sixteen days in. I didn&#8217;t strictly follow end of day guidelines for Nano, calling it a day somewhere close to 1AM. I drafted a scene and a part of the next and it&#8217;s the best writing I&#8217;ve done all month. It&#8217;s what all others will be held up and compared to, and mocked mercilessly when they fall short.

I&#8217;ll be scrambling for words tonight. The Day job looms and I have my [Inkpunks][2] post to write for tomorrow. Plus, I&#8217;m deep into creating my first eBook, which is a lot more fun than I expected it to be. Certain long-term plans are slowly coming together in a way that make me want to cackle and wring my hands together.
