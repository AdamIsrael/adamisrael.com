I haven&#8217;t managed to get back to my usual morning schedule of writing yet. Dayjobbery filled most of the day, until I realized that the stack of tissues piling up beside me and the general malaise that I felt was part of a deeper issue. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s some weird combination of a head cold, flu, a fibro flare, or accidental glutening but I spent a chunk of the afternoon in bed and the first few hours of the evening just trying to focus.

I knocked out the first 800 words fairly quickly, and had another hour to write from the coffee shop when I took Andrea to work. I was pretty sure I could pull off another 800. Headphones on, I&#8217;m just starting in and I glance up to see the manager flagging me down and waving me to the back of the store. Andrea&#8217;s co-worker on the midnight shift passed out. They helped her to the back, where she completely blacked out. I helped her from there &#8212; made sure it wasn&#8217;t low blood sugar, made her drink orange juice anyways, and took her home.

My big lesson from writing today is that I&#8217;m still dealing with structural issues. I&#8217;ve got multiple points of view, plots and sub-plots, but only a vague sense of how I should organize it as far as chapter go. In a free fall sort of way, it&#8217;s nice to just write without worrying about the deeper structure, knowing that I will puzzle together the lattice of this spiderweb later. 

I&#8217;ve fallen a little shy of the daily average, but it&#8217;s only day three. I&#8217;m going to get a jumpstart on tomorrow&#8217;s numbers tonight, and plan to make some big numbers on the weekend while Andrea&#8217;s sleeping. There&#8217;s this wall when I&#8217;m writing, but it&#8217;s kind of soft. I can feel give when I push against it. I know that it&#8217;s close to crumbling and when it does, words are going to spill out like they used to, when I used to sit and drop a thousand words an hour without really trying.
