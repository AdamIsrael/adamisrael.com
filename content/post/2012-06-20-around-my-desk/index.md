There are now four days until the Clarion write-a-thon begins on June 24th, where I will continue work on my novel-in-progress and attempt to add 30k new words over the course of six weeks.

It&#8217;s been a busy lead up to the write-a-thon because, frankly, I&#8217;ve been unfucking a few things structurally. Writing a novel feels a bit like building an engine from scratch when your only previous experience is with watching someone else do it. Sure, you know the processes and what&#8217;s important but putting all the pieces together in the right order is daunting. I&#8217;ve finally worked out what this novel needs, though, and started reorganizing what I have

It&#8217;s important that I have my workspace cluttered appropriately. Since I work and write in the same space, having familiar things around helps me slip into a creative mindset when I&#8217;ve spent a day doing other things. Among them are:

Books:

  * On Craft, Structure, and Career
      * Steering the Craft, by Ursula K. Le Guin
      * Writing the Breakout Novel, by Donald Maass
      * Booklife, by Jeff VanderMeer
  * Research, inspiration, or interesting and relevant:
      * Mistress of the Vatican: The True Story of Olimpia Maidalchini: The Secret Female Pope, by Eleanor Herman
      * The Complete Book of Baby Names, by Lesley Bolton
      * The Magick of Aleister Crowley by Lon Milo Duquette
      * A Field Guide to Demons, Fairies, Fallen Angels and Other Subversive Spirits, by Carol and Dinah Mack
      * Dark History of the Popes, by Brenda Ralph Lewis
      * Book of Lies, edited by Richard Metzger
      * The Dictionary of Mythology, by J.A. Coleman

Random things:

  * My favorite dice:
      * 1 d4
      * 2 d6
      * 2 d10
      * 1 d20
  * A mostly empty package of chocolate-covered coffee beans
  * Pens, pencils, highlighters, and various art supplies
  * A bunch of notebooks filled with various notes and ideas.
  * A desktop-sized scratchpad
  * Graph paper
  * Dueling [Eleventh Doctor](1) figures w/TARDIS
  * Headphones
  * An empty bottle of [Hakutsuru draft sake](2)
  * A lot of 3&#215;5 index cards
  * A cork board with notes from friends, inspirational quotes, and the [Norse Crisis Flowchart](3)
  * A map of Chicago
  * A map of the neighborhoods of Chicago

You might pick up on a few things about what I&#8217;m writing, based on what&#8217;s around my desk. If you like dark urban fantasy, tattoos and magic, secret histories of the church, angels, demons, and a good story, all I can say is, maybe you and I should be friends.

If you&#8217;re thinking of participating in the write-a-thon, we have nifty teams this year to <del>egg you on</del> encourage you when you&#8217;re feeling crestfallen. Also, and alternatively, you can [sponsor me](4) or [one of the many](5) writers. All the money goes to the Clarion Foundation, which uses the tax-deductible donations for things like student scholarships. It&#8217;s not too late!
