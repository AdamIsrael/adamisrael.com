The news was too much to bear. The man who ran his presidential campaign on a platform of racism, homophobia, and xenophobia secured the majority electoral vote (but not the popular vote) and was poised to don the title of President-elect. I went to bed, knowing that the country of my birth had just taken a step -- were pushed -- backwards.

I woke the next morning to realize it wasn't all just a bad dream. Trump will become the next President of the United States.

My Twitter and Facebook timelines were filled with people, scared, because they belong to one of the many demographics who Trump has aimed his followers hatred at. I understood, on an intellectual and emotional level, why their fears are valid. It took a while for reality to filter through my privilege. I appear to be a CIS white middle-class male. Even though I'm not, I enjoy the privilege of such.

I was raised Lutheran. I had grandfathers and uncles who were ministers. I heard the same couple stories about our family history repeated. We were German-Jewish. We had family in Germany that owned a department store before the war. When the war broke out, our family feared that our family bible, which contains a family tree dating back to the time of Martin Luther, would fall into the wrong hands, and so it was sent off for safekeeping. One story has it sent to an uncle -- a minister in Chicago -- who was later killed by a street car. The other tale was that it was sent to relatives in California.

Death, Dementia, Alzheimer, and fear has obscured a lot of my family history and our personal identities.
