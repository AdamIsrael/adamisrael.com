_Well no_, because I&#8217;m not ready to talk about that just yet.

Hershel posted his list of [stuff he can&#8217;t live without][1] the other day and it got me to thinking. I&#8217;ve learned a lot about myself and materialism over the past two years. I found that I don&#8217;t need a lot of stuff to be happy. Not that I&#8217;m a monk or anything but I&#8217;ve come to understand the &#8220;less is more&#8221; mentality. There&#8217;s few things outside of the obvious food/shelter that are must-haves, but I do have a list of things that I wouldn&#8217;t fathom being without.

Some might say it&#8217;s cliche, but my list starts with Andrea. Without her, I might still be in the dark place and that wasn&#8217;t good for anyone involved.

  * My Moleskin notebooks &#8212; they go where I go.
  * A fountain pen. Right now it&#8217;s the [Azure Blue Regatta by Monteverde][2] that my Mom gave me for Christmas. I have a different pen, my first real fountain pen, given to me by the awesome [Kyle Cassidy][3], awaiting repairs.
  * I suppose I should claim my Macbook Pro as a necessity. I&#8217;ve almost forgotten what it&#8217;s like to work from a desktop.
  * Friends. As introverted and socially awkward as I tend to be, my friends bring me more joy than I can express.
  * Twitter/Facebook/Email/LiveJournal &#8211; how I communicate with most of my far-flung friends.
  * My iPod &#8211; Music is a very important part of my life that I don&#8217;t seem to talk about that often.
  * My iPhone &#8211; I deliberated leaving it off the list, because I&#8217;d rather use it to text or twitter than to talk.

Maybe what this says about me is that I&#8217;m an extrovert trapped inside the mind of an introvert. Pretty much everything that I consider important to keep near and dear revolves around communicating with the world.
