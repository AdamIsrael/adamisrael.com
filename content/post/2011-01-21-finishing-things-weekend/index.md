This weekend has been declared crunch time, and as it turns out there&#8217;s also a Finishing Things Weekend (#FTW) happening on Twitter this weekend. Rockin&#8217;. I love peer pressure.

The things that I want/need to get done:

  * Revise last weekend&#8217;s flash story (flutters eyelashes atÂ critiquers) and submit it
  * Draft another Tesla&#8217;s Daughter Super Hero story (yes, it&#8217;s apparently turning into a series)
  * Write new flash fiction for this weekend&#8217;s [Codex](1) Weekend Warriors contest

That&#8217;s kind of a lot, but I think I can pull it off. No plans other than writing and sleeping.
