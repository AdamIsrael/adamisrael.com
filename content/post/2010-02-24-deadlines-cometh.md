February is coming to a close and I&#8217;m scrambling like mad. Clarion closes to applications on March 1st. One application story is done. I have a second one more or less ready, but I&#8217;m debating a last minute replacement.

I&#8217;m putting the grind wheel and polish to my as yet untitled story for the [Scheherazade&#8217;s Facade][1] anthology, due February 28th.Â  It&#8217;s shaping up into something that makes me happy. I pushed myself when writing this and for that reason I&#8217;m also considering using it as my second Clarion story.

I&#8217;ll be getting back to schedule after these deadlines have passed. I&#8217;m behind on updating my goals and schedule but the progress I&#8217;ve made, despite being knocked on my ass for a few weeks, is satisfying.
