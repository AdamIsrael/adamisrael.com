Seeing as we&#8217;re close to the end of 2011 and it&#8217;s unlikely I&#8217;ll have anything else published this calendar year, now is as good a time as any to recap the short fiction I&#8217;ve had published in the last twelve months.

Self-promotion is so totally not my thing. [Jaym Gates](1) recent Inkpunks post about [awards season](2) was a good reminder that I should be doing this, though. I&#8217;m not entirely certain I&#8217;m doing this the right way, but here it is.

  * December 2011 &#8211; &#8220;My City of Ruins&#8221; &#8212; [Finding Home: Community in Apocalyptic Worlds](3)
  * September 2011 – “History of the Flesh” – [Crimson Pact 2](4)
  * April 2011 – “[Dog Days](5)” – [Crossed Genres](6)
  * April 2011 – “Indigo’s Gambit” – [Extinct Doesn’t Mean Forever](7)

These are stories that I love and was honored to have published. Please, read, but only nominate as you see fit.
