It&#8217;s a good feeling to put the word END after the last paragraph of a manuscript. This story was born week five of Clarion but I couldn&#8217;t make it work then. A little bit of time away and with four days of sporadic effort, it&#8217;s a story. Rough around the edges like any first draft but I expect those will be caught when I sent it to beta readers later this week. Shitty first draft or not, I&#8217;m pleased with how it&#8217;s turned out so far.

Project: Sex/magic story, now with more poly love, a plump dominatrix, a Chicago swinger&#8217;s club, and one pissed off magician, tentatively titled <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Way Out is Through</span>.

New words written: 484

Reason for stopping: End of story

Tomorrow is a travel day for me. Back to Santa Monica for a week of work and, with luck, more success in finding a room or apartment for rent. While I&#8217;m galavanting across the country, I&#8217;ll be outlining my story for the [20Spec anthology](2), which is open for submissions on October 11th. The plan is to get <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Way Out is Through</span> sent off to a couple of beta readers and then work on the first draft of my tale of Romani revenge, Eye of the People.
