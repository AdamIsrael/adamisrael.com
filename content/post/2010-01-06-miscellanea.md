#### Writing

It&#8217;s really too early to tell how things are going to work out long-term but so far I feel good. Not overwhelmed by keeping my spreadsheets updated or gut checking my short-term goals. I&#8217;m right where I want to be. I hope I can say the same thing a week and a month from now.

I&#8217;m writing a little bit every day. I&#8217;ve surpassed my 250 words/day goal. It may not seem like many but that&#8217;s a novel-worth of words a year. I write longhand &#8212; my moleskin and fountain pen are never far from my side. Usually I&#8217;m a slow writer, bogged down by my internal editor. Not so much lately. The words are coming out fairly smoothly.

#### Travel

Today, there was some conversation on twitter about air travel that caught my eye. I&#8217;ve done a fair amount of travel for the day job over the years and know the pains of (in)security checkpoints, TSA ineptitude and airport delays. I really wish the train were a viable option for business travel, but 5 hours of flying, plus a day on either side to catch up on sleep, beats the 3-4 days the train would take. Still, I think it&#8217;s something Andrea and I will do when we can afford to take a vacation in a couple of years. A trip through the Canadian Rockies, then down the west coast to visit Seattle, Portland and parts of California sounds about right.

#### Reading

I&#8217;m probably a quarter of the way through [Jeff VanderMeer](2)&#8216;s _[Finch](3)_. It&#8217;s weird. It&#8217;s noir. It&#8217;s awesome. I&#8217;ve read some of his short fiction and enjoyed it. Obviously, I&#8217;ve read _Booklife_ and _City of Saints and Madmen_ is sitting on my side table. This is apparently my winter of VanderMeer. I&#8217;ve fallen behind on reading in the last few years. Coming back to it feels a bit like rediscovering and old friend moved in next door.
