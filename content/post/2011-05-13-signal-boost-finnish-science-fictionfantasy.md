Diversity is something often on my mind. I&#8217;ve been thrilled to see translated Science Fiction becoming available in bookstores recently. It&#8217;s easy to forget that we &#8212; the white, english speakers of the world &#8212; aren&#8217;t the only ones with fantastic imaginations.

My Clarion instructors Jeff and Ann VanderMeer have an almost encyclopedia-like knowledge of foreign fiction. They recently spent some time in Finland, meeting with many of the Finnish SF/F community.

[Finnish Science Fiction and Fantasy: Johanna Sinisalo, Hannu Rajaniemi, and Moomins](1)

[Finnish SF and Fantasy: An Established Community, a Surge of Talent](2)

[Finnish Weirdâ€“and Finnish SF/F Links Round-Up](3)

It grows ever obvious that we are becoming a global community. I sincerely hope that we see more and more international fiction translated for a wider audience (that, or the discovery of the [babel fish](4)) so that everyone can enjoy these talented authors.
