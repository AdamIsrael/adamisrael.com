One good thing, maybe the only good thing, about being so far removed from friends and family is that there isn&#8217;t much social life to speak of. That means on Friday night, after a post-work nap, I made some serious story progress. If all goes according to plan, I&#8217;ll make draft on this by the end of the weekend. Next I only need a title.

**Project**: Tantric sex/magic story, now with more poly love, a plump dominatrix, a Chicago swinger&#8217;s club, and one pissed off magician.

 **New words written**: 1,149

 **Reason for stopping**: Out of ink. Literally.

**QOTD**:

> I postpone death by living, by suffering, by error, by risking, by giving, by loving. &#8212; Anais Nin
