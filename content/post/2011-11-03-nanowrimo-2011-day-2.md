Work all day followed by a quick nap and no words before 7:30pm. Andrea kicked me out of the house and I trundled off to the coffee house, was disappointed by the lack of London Fog Tea, and sat to write.

When I&#8217;m working on a project, it takes me a few days to hit my stride. So far, so good. I did a lot better with suppressing the urge to edit and hey, I made up for yesterdays shortfall.

For all the outlining that I did leading up to Nano, I could have stuck with just my extensive bullet point. What I&#8217;d originally thought were three chapters were scenes, marking the completion of Chapter 1. I&#8217;m kind of winging it from this point out. I know all of the major points that need to happen and how the story ends. How I stitch it all together will be done on the fly.

The research I did, on the other hand, is all worthwhile. While the words are rough and sometimes horribly ugly, the ideas are solid. I can&#8217;t wait to get deeper into the story and see how it evolves from the original spark.

I&#8217;m kind of glad I didn&#8217;t finished reading [Writing the Breakout Novel][2] before Nano. It&#8217;s been sitting on my self for a while and I meant to get through it but I ran out of time. I may be slightly over-prepared for what I need Nano for and it&#8217;s slowing me down. What I read of that book is awesome and would be one more thing for me to try to ignore just to get words on the page. I will read it before I even think about rewrites/revisions, though.
