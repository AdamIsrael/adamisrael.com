I&#8217;ve survived day two of walking myself into a non-round shape. It&#8217;s not an easy task. Fibromyalgia, my version of it, includes bouts of fatigue. I tried doing something as simple as lunges as part of my friend Sandra&#8217;s virtual bootcamp; twenty minutes of that put me into a fatigue crash that had me sleeping 36 out of the next 48 hours and, frankly, weeks of depression just thinking about that failure.

Exercise can induce/worsen Fibromyalgia symptoms but exercise also ease symptoms. It&#8217;s a bit of a catch-22, frankly. The other benefits of getting my fat ass in motion is improving my quality of life, extending my lifespan, curtailing my type-2 diabetes and all sorts of other things.

I&#8217;m taking small steps to start. Walking, and gradually &#8212; very gradually &#8212; working my way up. [Two days, five miles](1). An hour a day, in the late afternoon when I&#8217;m most tempted to take a nap. Ultimately, this is a lifestyle change and radical changes are less likely to stick. For me, at least.

Walking is good. It&#8217;s a solitary thing for me and it always puts me in a good headspace. Today, for example, I worked out how to fix some problems in a story I want to revise and submit soon. Then I spent the rest of the time listening to what may be the most awesome walking/running song ever created on repeat: The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner by Iron Maiden.

Settling into a proper schedule between writing, working, and exercise is really doing good things. I&#8217;m already feeling more energetic and I&#8217;ve written more words this week than the whole month combined.
