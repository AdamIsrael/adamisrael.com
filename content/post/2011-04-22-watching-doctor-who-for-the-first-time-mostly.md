[][1] Up until a year ago, I&#8217;d only seen a few episodes of Doctor Who &#8212; mostly season 1. I was interested by what I saw but I prefer to watch shows sequentially, even though the [wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey][2] nature of the show makes viewing out of order just as enjoyable. Then Season 5 came along and I made a point of watching it from the beginning. I was hooked within the first episode.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-435" title="tumblr_l7le9oQxKs1qajupo" src="http://www.adamisrael.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/tumblr_l7le9oQxKs1qajupo.gif" alt="" width="200" height="113" />][3]

I watched, and rewatched, Season 5. Because I&#8217;d only seen Season 1 before, I&#8217;d considered Christopher Eccleston to be my Doctor, if pressed. Many of my friends were in David Tennet&#8217;s camp but I missed his reign as doctor almost entirely. I proudly declared for Matt Smith, despite the early doubters.

With the build-up to Season 6, and having rewatched Season 5 for the _umpteenth_ time, it dawned on me that I had four full seasons of Doctor Who, almost entirely new to me, to watch. Plus, three seasons of Torchwood!

The sword fight with <del><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_the_Merciless">Ming the Merciless</a></del> the Sycorax reeked of cheese, although the return of the hand was a very nice touch later on. There were tons of great episodes interspersed throughout, with the occasional awesomeness that left me raving to anyone I could corner. When <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_Time">The End of Time</a> came around, I expected to be sad but I cried like a baby.

Season 6 starts&#8230;tomorrow. How do I feel about this?

Yeah. I&#8217;ve watched every preview clip I can get my hands on. I&#8217;m going to shotgun through my favorite episodes of Season 5 today and tomorrow in preparation. There will be hors d&#8217;oeuvres, although I&#8217;m not sure what kind yet. BBC America has this handy set of [recipes][6], but sadly, I&#8217;m allergic to most of them.

ETA: Also? River Song. I just now put [Silence in the Library][7]/[Forest of the Dead][8], River&#8217;s first appearance, together with the Season 6 tease, Silence is coming. My head, it might burst from excitement. There&#8217;s a few odd coincidences involving River Song, and I don&#8217;t think those are happening by chance.
