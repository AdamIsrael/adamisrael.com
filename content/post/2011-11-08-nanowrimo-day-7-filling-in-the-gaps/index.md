Doing nano during the week is the most challenging for me. I work a lot, which means I need to be even more disciplined with my time. Thanks to some work issues, I didn&#8217;t even start to think about writing until close to 7PM and I really didn&#8217;t think I was going to make it. Also, I had a bad case of the don&#8217;t wanna&#8217;s. So, I gave myself an hour break and played XBox before I got to writing.

Project: Black Mirror

New words written: 1,809

Reason for stopping: End of Chapter

Looking over what I have done so far, I can see where I have some minor pacing issues. The biggest thing I&#8217;ll need to deal with, later this week, are the things I didn&#8217;t outline for. I planned on thirty chapters. I&#8217;ve drafted thirteen. I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s fair to even call them chapters, really, but that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m sticking with. There&#8217;ll probably be more of them, on the shorter end, rather than fewer, bulkier ones. Anyways, I have some gaps to fill in, where the story&#8217;s evolved and stretched a bit more than anticipated. Not a bad problem, just something I need to budget a little more time for.
