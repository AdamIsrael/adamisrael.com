The bad news is I am now fluent in Fluish, having spent a good chunk of the day sleeping away the sickness.

When I did bother to wake up and shake off the cobwebs, I grabbed 10 books off the shelf and started making notes. A few favorites, a few classics, a few modern contemporaries, SF and F. I looked at point of view and how each was structured. The results were interesting.

Most of the novels were straightforward, chapters with one scene break, if any. A few were broken into larger sub-sections. One was sectioned by day. In other words, the structure was made to fit the story.

The number of chapters varied a bit, from 18 to 39 (ignoring the one outlier that had 104), with average lengths between 1,500 and 6,000 words.

It was a good study, but what it really did was tell me that every story has it&#8217;s own beat and it&#8217;s up to the author to discover what that is. I did some clean up of what I&#8217;d done so far and I have a better idea of how I&#8217;m structuring this story going forward, at least through this first draft. There are plenty of other things I need to worry about fixing first (like finishing it).

I&#8217;ve made it through day four, which counts for something, an while I&#8217;m not exactly where I&#8217;d like to be, I&#8217;m not too far off. We&#8217;re just now upon the first weekend of the month so I&#8217;m planning to push hard and make some good progress. Not just to see word count, but to see how else the story will surprise me as it evolves.
