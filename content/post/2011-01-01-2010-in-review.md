Every year has its ups and downs and 2010 was no exception. Still, it felt like a harder year in many ways. There were unexpected challenges by way of financial disasters, health setbacks and personal roadblocks. At times, I didn&#8217;t know how I&#8217;d get by day to day. Despite everything, the year ended on a high note. All we can do for the days ahead is work smart and move forward.

  * Diagnosed with Fibromyalgia
  * Discovered I had Celiac
  * Denied re-entry to Canada
  * Moved in with Mom in Chicago
  * Divorce court: I still has it
  * Went to Clarion
  * Commuted between Chicago and California for work
  * Went bankrupt
  * Moved to California
  * After eight months, moved back to Canada

[Clarion][1] was a huge thing for me. A decades-long dream realized. The sacrifices that I made to go were substancial, personally financially, and emotionally. Six weeks, six instructors (Seven, in our case; we love you, Ellen.), and eighteen people that are lifelong friends. Five months later I&#8217;m still digesting it all, as a new batch of applications are making their way to San Diego, but I can still say, unequivocally, it was worth it.

  * 7ish stories written
  * 13 story submissions
  * 7 personal rejections (3 from pro markets)
  * 1 rewrite request
  * 0 sales
  * 1 publication

The emotional low points were especially difficult to deal with. Being separated from Andrea for eight months filled me with a darkness. I&#8217;m lucky to have so many friends, some of which I had a chance to hang out with this year, that made the loneliness easier to bear. Also, while not directly mine, my mother&#8217;s cancer and brother&#8217;s kidney failure were and are reminders that life is precious and not to take it for granted.

Goodbye, 2010. I defeated you and leveled up in the process. 2011, consider this your warning: I&#8217;m so going to kick your ass.
