title: Perfkit and Juju
---


*State the problem*

Performance is hard. That's why there are so many tools to measure it.

*Solution is benchmarking*

Getting to the bottom of the performance monkey barrel requires a deft hand and good aim.

*Differences between this and normal machine benchmarking*

*Enter perfkit, the why and the how.*

*Awesome upstream gushing chapter*

*We want the guys who work on perfkit to be like “Wow, those Canonical guys really love our stuff”*

*Sample benchmark*

*Do everything on GCE, we’ll let the user infer they can do this anywhere*

*Set everything up, with perfkit driving juju*

*Show results*

*Awesome graph porn*

*Conclusion*

*Using perfkit? You have all of this already, it’s included!*

*Try to not make it a commercial about Juju, the tone should be something more akin to “well of course it comes with some Juju features, how else would anyone do this?” *
