It&#8217;s a funny thing. When I wrote tech news and my Linux column, I felt pretty confident about what I was doing. I could debate policy and technology without hesitation. I&#8217;ve been on panels, given demonstrations and was, frankly, highly opinionated and usually right.

It&#8217;s different when it comes to fiction, though. I&#8217;ve made sales and gone to Clarion. I&#8217;m comfortable with what I do and don&#8217;t know but I don&#8217;t usually feel like I&#8217;m speaking with authority. Oddly, when I first started out I could sit and write a couple thousand words in a sitting. Now, I am more methodical, carefully choosing my words and writing much, much slower. The results are much better but there are times I wish I could reclaim some of that speed.

I&#8217;ve heard, on a few occasions, that it takes a year or so to fully recover or internalize the lessons of Clarion. Maybe I&#8217;m still in that phase and on the other side I&#8217;ll gain some newfound confidence in my work that will allow me to stop second-guessing myself. I&#8217;m happy with the end result of my work. I believe it&#8217;s of professional quality even if I haven&#8217;t made that first pro sale yet. I should be happy with what I have but I guess I wouldn&#8217;t be me if I didn&#8217;t push myself to the next level.
