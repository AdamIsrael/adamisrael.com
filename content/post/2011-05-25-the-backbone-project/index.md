I was reading [Ferret&#8217;s blog](1) this morning, as I often do, and I saw a familiar name mentioned: [Amy Sundberg](2). I&#8217;ve realized over the last year that I have much in common with Amy, who I had the pleasure to meet at World Fantasy last year. Her posts on [Ambiversion](3) and [the awesomeness of being an introvert](4) kind of clued me in but her latest one about [being less wishy-washy](5) really hits home.

> The estimable Ferrett shared a link on his post on [how to get comments](6). There is much good advice to be had in this essay and [the one about blogging that precedes it](7), but there was one sentence that particularly stood out for me. Ferrett says, “If you’re a conciliatory person by nature, writing a pleasant essay that excuses whatever it is that bugs you with a “But I guess that’s how people are” will not get comments either, because you’ll be so wishy-washy that nobody will be able to disagree with you.”

That describes me to a fault. In person, around people I trust, I feel free to rant or evangelize about things I feel strongly about but when I get online something inside of me wilts. The way I feel about certain things doesn&#8217;t change based on who I hang out with but stick me in a group, even one I&#8217;m fairly comfortable with, and I shut down; I sprout pedals and cling to the nearest wall. I even find it hard to break into a conversation I&#8217;m already included in.

That behavior has, more or less, carried over here. I abandon posts half-written because I worry about offending people, or I read someone else&#8217;s thoughts on the subject and convince myself that adding my voice would just muddy the waters. It&#8217;s maddening. I want to be liked (or, not disliked) and to post alternative viewpoints may offend someone.

It does strike me &#8212; a tiny voice of reason inside my head &#8212; that the person who would be offended by the reasoned but differing opinion probably isn&#8217;t the kind of person I who&#8217;s approval I would want in the first place.

Consider me a backer and participant in Amy&#8217;s Backbone Project. I&#8217;m going to speak my mind here; to avoid wishy-washy but still take into consideration alternate viewpoints and discussion, because that&#8217;s what I&#8217;d like this to be: a platform to discuss topics that I&#8217;m passionate about. I will not troll to get a response from people because that&#8217;s just plain wrong but I will, secretly, hope to spark discussion.

Now, I&#8217;m going to go clean up my RSS reader, because it would have been a damn shame to miss Amy&#8217;s post and I probably would have, or would have seen it after the fact, if not for Ferret&#8217;s mention on LiveJournal.
