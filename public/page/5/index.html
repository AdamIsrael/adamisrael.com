      <p>Sometimes, when I sit down and stare at a white blank page, my heart races. I fear the mistakes I’m about to make, at the same time I’m in awe of the creation about to spring forth the tip of my pen. I’ve done it before. I’ll do it again. I am not a fast writer, but I am a sprinter.
Sprinting is this — pen to paper, writing around 500 words/day until a story is done.</p>

      <p>I sat down this morning, meaning to write a blog post about focus and patience, with OCD tendencies. It would have been my first substantial post since the beginning of the month, but when I logged in to WordPress I found my site unresponsive. Temperamental, even. Other sites I host on the same server, but different accounts, were fine. I was about to blame my half-full cup of coffee when Google interceded and warned me that my site was being suspicious as all fuck.</p>

      <p>It&#8217;s now my second February living in southwest Ontario, with 50F weather and scattered rain showers. The snow, which didn&#8217;t fall until mid-January, is a memory and it will be at least a week before we have any chance of seeing more.
What the hell, Canada?
When people learned I was moving to Canada, I heard all kinds of jokes. Eh? Eh? One was about seeing moose, which I&#8217;ve seen no trace of here but I have found in northern Wisconsin, where my Dad lives.</p>

      <p>Life with chronic health conditions and no health insurance is interesting.
Celiac disease is pretty much a condition of maintenance. There’s no cure and the only preventative measure is avoiding eating or drinking gluten (wheat, barley, rye, and oats). Gluten is everywhere. Beer and bread are bad but I’ve found it in foods I would never have suspected, like tomato soup, sausage and lunch meats, and many, many sauces. Flour is a cheap filler and thickener so it’s commonly used, which makes the life of a celiac a royal bitch.</p>

      <p>I thought it&#8217;d be interesting to look at some rough numbers, based on my Duotrope stats, year over year.
2010
13 submissions to 10 different markets
4 stories on submission
13 rejections, 5 personal (38%)
10 markets
0 acceptances
2011
43 submissions to 36 different markets
11 stories on submission
39 rejections, 16 personal (41%)
4 acceptances
Misc. Stats
Each year saw one story pulled from circulation after one submission (one was a reprint from 2008)</p>

      <p>Seeing as we&#8217;re close to the end of 2011 and it&#8217;s unlikely I&#8217;ll have anything else published this calendar year, now is as good a time as any to recap the short fiction I&#8217;ve had published in the last twelve months.
Self-promotion is so totally not my thing. Jaym Gates recent Inkpunks post about awards season was a good reminder that I should be doing this, though. I&#8217;m not entirely certain I&#8217;m doing this the right way, but here it is.</p>

      <p>We&#8217;d been in California for a few days and the previous night at my work Christmas party. Three years ago this morning, we flew to Las Vegas. One of us (not me) was airsick as we landed in the middle of a sand storm. Ironic, because this was literally a whirlwind. Work put us up in a lavish hotel on the strip, one of the last acts of kindness I&#8217;ll remember them for.</p>

      <p>If you had asked me if members of Congress were exempt from insider trading before today, I would have said yes, of course. I would have argued that, with the kinds of information that our congressmen and -woman are privy to, they especially should not be allowed to use non-public information to trade stock for financial gain. Knowing when to buy or sell a stock when a company is about to have a contract terminated, or is about to come under congressional investigation, for example, is privileged, sometimes even classified information.</p>

      <p>NaNoWriMo is over. I failed to win. I failed, but there are lessons in failure.
I set out to do a few things aside from writing 50k words. I wanted to learn to turn off my internal editor when I needed to, so that I could write first drafts on the computer. I wanted to write something longer than I&#8217;d written before, previously around 6,000 words. I wanted to get a better understanding of novel structure.</p>
