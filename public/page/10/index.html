I now have the last of the paperwork I need to continue with my permanent residence application, my Square reader, so I can accept credit card payments, and the sealed letter from the Illinois DMV so I can get my Ontario drivers license. We drive to the nearest driving center with the sealed letter in hand.</p>

      <p>My dear friend and fellow Inkpunk Christie Yant recently wrote about [the dos and don&#8217;ts of your online presence][3] and it inspired me to do a heavy overhaul of my own website. I haven&#8217;t been happy with it for a while. It pulled in things like images from flickr, recently played music from Last.fm, and didn&#8217;t show enough real content. This new theme suites me, I think. [3]: http://www.inkpunks.com/2011/05/06/the-dos-and-donts-of-your-online-presence/</p>

      <p>I missed a couple days of writing last week, which included a day spent trying to get fingerprints taken for immigration and ended up with an appointment one week out. Who knew that fingerprint technology had advanced beyond ink pads? One set for Ontario, and a set each for the FBI and State of Illinois to request my records. The saga, she continues. My Illinois driving records have been received by Mom and will soon be on their way here.</p>

      <p>[]1 Up until a year ago, I&#8217;d only seen a few episodes of Doctor Who &#8212; mostly season 1. I was interested by what I saw but I prefer to watch shows sequentially, even though the wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey nature of the show makes viewing out of order just as enjoyable. Then Season 5 came along and I made a point of watching it from the beginning. I was hooked within the first episode.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;d ask Neil Gaiman this himself (and yes, I know I&#8217;ve tagged him on Twitter on the off chance he sees this), but he&#8217;s a busy guy and the odds of getting a chance to talk to him are, frankly, bewilderingly astronomical. I&#8217;ll throw this question out to everyone because I&#8217;m genuinely curious to hear more thoughts on this. At Clarion last year, I wrote a short story inspired by Norse mythology, set in America.</p>

      <p>Six years ago, I was a freelance software engineer, with a background in advertising, search engines and high-performance web applications, when an introductory email lead me to help build a new company. I was employee #1; I built a multi-million dollar ad serving platform from scratch and in the process I worked sales, accounting, administration, development, and management. In the end, though, there is something to be said about being your own man, being able to make decisions and see your visions to fruition.</p>
