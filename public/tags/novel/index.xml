      <description>&lt;p&gt;Can you believe I managed to blog three whole days in a row &lt;del&gt;last week&lt;/del&gt; two weeks ago? Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently I&amp;#8217;m running in low power mode right now. New meds, a heavy work schedule, and two short story deadlines. Oh, and I&amp;#8217;m outlining NOVEL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve got around twenty unfinished short stories in inventory. My plan is to revise a short story every month or so while drafting novel. I don&amp;#8217;t plan to draft any new short stories until I&amp;#8217;ve finished this novel draft, unless something new like &lt;a href=&#34;1&#34;&gt;Shanghai Steam&lt;/a&gt; comes along or a specific invite comes along that catches my interest. Shiny is shiny, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How long will this take? Fuck if I know. I&amp;#8217;ve never finished a novel before. When I&amp;#8217;m drafting short stories I average 500 words/day with relative ease. I suspect I can double that but I&amp;#8217;ll be conservative and give myself until my birthday next summer &amp;#8212; almost exactly 11 months away. If I don&amp;#8217;t have a complete draft by then, something is seriously wrong and the &lt;a href=&#34;2&#34;&gt;Inkpunks&lt;/a&gt; are formally invited to visit a beatdown on my ass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expect regular status updates complete with word widget and maybe even tiny extracts of out of context words that I&amp;#8217;m not totally horrified by.&lt;/p&gt;
