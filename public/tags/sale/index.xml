      <description>It&amp;#8217;s launch day at Goldfish Grimm&amp;#8217;s Spicy Fiction Sushi, which includes my story &amp;#8220;Control&amp;#8221; and an interview with yours truly.
This is one of my Clarion stories. Like any writer, I&amp;#8217;m happy when a story sells but I&amp;#8217;m also particularly pleased that this story has found its home.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been running slow on spoons and managing my time carefully, and I neglected to post this sooner.

Pre-orders will be available on their website November 1st, and the anthology will be released on December 15th, just in time for Christmas.

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m pleased to announce the sale of a flash fiction story, &amp;#8220;History of the Flesh&amp;#8221;, to volume 2 of The Crimson Pact anthology.
My story of a psychometrist turned sineater started almost two and a half years ago, during the Codex Weekend Warrior contest. For five consecutive weekends, we write a flash fiction inspired by one of three posted prompts and post it by the wee hours of Monday morning.</description>

      <description>I am pleased to announce that I&amp;#8217;ve sold my story, Dog Days, to Crossed Genres for their March issue, Superheroes. This is the story I referenced in my latest Inkpunks post, Writer’s Toolkit: Tarot Cards.
I&amp;#8217;m particularly tickled by this sale. It&amp;#8217;s my first acceptance post-Clarion, of a story I&amp;#8217;m particularly enamored with, to one of my favorite markets. Happy writer is happy.</description>
