      <description>As writers, we fill our toolbox with things that help us in our craft. I&amp;#8217;ve been experimenting with a few new things of late, trying to boost my productivity. Two of them in particular are making a difference.
I haven&amp;#8217;t been involved in many word wars &amp;#8212; timed writing sessions with one or more other writers. Set a short time limit, say 15 or 30 minutes, and write until it&amp;#8217;s over.</description>

      <description>Part of my new and improved resolve to Finish Things is accountability, and to that end I&amp;#8217;ve created a master spreadsheet for the year where I&amp;#8217;m tracking my daily writing, good things that happen (h/t Christie Yant), projects I want to work on, and deadlines I&amp;#8217;m working towards. It&amp;#8217;s not perfect, but it&amp;#8217;s a start.
I&amp;#8217;m trying to work every day while I&amp;#8217;m involved in a project. Writing is, or should be, what I spend the most time on, at least at this stage in my current WIP.</description>

2011
43 submissions to 36 different markets

Misc. Stats
Each year saw one story pulled from circulation after one submission (one was a reprint from 2008)</description>
