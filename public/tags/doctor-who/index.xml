      <description>[](1) Up until a year ago, I&amp;#8217;d only seen a few episodes of Doctor Who &amp;#8212; mostly season 1. I was interested by what I saw but I prefer to watch shows sequentially, even though the wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey nature of the show makes viewing out of order just as enjoyable. Then Season 5 came along and I made a point of watching it from the beginning. I was hooked within the first episode.</description>
