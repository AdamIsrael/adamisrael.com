      <description>We reached two long-awaited milestones in our household this week.
The last maintenance payment to my ex-wife, month 30 of 30, was mailed off. This represented a sizable portion of my income. It’s been a wild, dramatic ride that is now officially over. No more living in fear that I’m going to get a call from my lawyer and have to shuttle back to Illinois on short notice for an ‘emergency’ hearing or stressing out about what I say on the Internet because it will (and it did) find it’s way back to my ex and used against me in wildly out-of-context ways.</description>

      <description>This was a good news/bad news kind of week on the medical front. I wish I had more energy to talk about it, but I am running low on spoons and need to conserve them.
Good news:
 Kidneys and Thyroid are normal.   It’s not Multiple Sclerosis.   It’s probably not Lupus.   The bad news:
 There is still a chance it could be Lupus, so I had more blood drawn to confirm/deny.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month I &lt;a href=&#34;1&#34;&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt; that I was heading in for some long overdue checkup with the doctor. Many of you have been following my progress on &lt;a href=&#34;2&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. I’m a firm believer in paying it forward and that includes being open and honest about sensitive topics. Forewarned is forearmed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>I used to think I was a superhero. A rotund, pasty, privileged superhero, but superhero none the less. I’ve held jobs more or less consistently since the time I was twelve. How much I work became a running joke among my friends. I abused my body with unhealthy amounts of caffeine to squeeze more work hours out of each day, and I did this for years without much of a break.</description>

      <description>My mom had reconstructive ankle surgery to correct some of long-term damage caused by polio so I spent the last few weeks with her, doing laundry and cooking and whatnot. I also took the opportunity to wear down my annual deductible and get a few lingering medical issues looked at. And while in Illinois, I picked up a rather nasty flu that has wiped me out completely.
Most of the effects of the flu are gone, knock on wood.</description>
