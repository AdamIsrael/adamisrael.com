      <description>I alluded to some good news yesterday; the first piece of it is more or less final now. As of this morning, I am done with divorce court. I have two months of maintenance (alimony) and lawyer fees left to pay and this will be a memory.
3 years, 2 months, 30 days
102,384,000 seconds
1,706,400 minutes
28,440 hours
169 weeks
In the time it took for this ordeal to end , I could have walked 5,925 miles (assuming 5 miles/day), from the Pacific to Atlantic coast and back.</description>
