      <description>&lt;p&gt;I felt a little blue this week, grousing over revisions and my sometimes fragile ego. I distracted myself by patiently refreshing the Writers of the Future blog and checking the mail every few minutes, hoping to see some word of the 2009 Q4 results. Well, the &lt;a href=&#34;1&#34;&gt;list of Honorable Mentions&lt;/a&gt; was released before they had a chance to &lt;a href=&#34;2&#34;&gt;update the blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Out of the thousands of stories that get submitted to the contest, a small percentage make it this far,&amp;#8221; Wentworth continued. &amp;#8220;Past Honorable Mention stories have gone on to see publication elsewhere. That is how competitive this contest is. The contest quality of submissions is the best of the best.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am pretty pleased to see my name on the list of Honorable Mentions. It certainly shook me out of my funk. I&amp;#8217;m one for one so far, so We&amp;#8217;ll see if I can keep up the streak with my Q1 submission. Now to see if I can find a good home for the Q4 story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an aside, is there any benefit to adding &amp;#8220;received Honorable Mention, Writers of the Future Q4 2009&amp;#8221; to a stories cover letter? My guess is no, since a shiny rejection is still a rejection and not relevant to the new market.&lt;/p&gt;
