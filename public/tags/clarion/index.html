      <p>It should be no surprise to anyone who knows me that the Clarion Writers Workshop is a thing near and dear to me. Attending the six-week workshop in 2010 was a milestone in my writing career. The annual write-a-thon, where writers commit to writing goals and ask friends, family,and strangers to pledge money to go towards funding the workshop. Saying &#8220;please give money&#8221; is something I do on very rare occasion, but this is something worthwhile.</p>

      <p>I may burst with glee. Tomorrow is Nikola Tesla day. Today, the Mad Scientist Journal published my secret history of Tesla, &#8220;Man Out of Time&#8220;. I even have word that someone on Facebook commented that they thought the story was a &#8220;great idea to run a game/one-shot on&#8221;. Katie Nyborg did the fabulous illustration for the interior. How much does this mean to me? Well, Tesla is my hero more so than any other historical figure ever.</p>

That&#8217;d be awesome. Life creeps up, with unavoidable things like responsibility and sleep but I have a secret that I&#8217;ll share with you. Lean a little close. That&#8217;s it, just a little closer. It&#8217;s a little maddening to miss your goals.</p>

      <p>The Clarion Write-a-thon began yesterday. I got some decent writing time in, despite a late start to the day and having to confront a would-be pervert attempting to flash his private bits at my favorite writing spot. I expect the first several days of writing to go slow as I revise the first chapter of the novel, trying to set the right tone and pace. The 25k words I wrote during last year&#8217;s Nanowrimo are, I realize, mostly outline but do span the length of the novel.</p>

      <p>The Clarion Write-a-thon starts on June 24th, running parallel to the six week workshop I attended in 2010. While this summers workshop students toil away in San Diego, I’ll be one of many writers helping to raise awareness and solicit donations to a cause we believe in. What is a write-a-thon, anyway? It&#8217;s just like a walk-a-thon. But instead of walking, we&#8217;re writing, and instead of making pledges per mile, we&#8217;re making pledges per word, chapter, or story.</p>

      <p>Two things make this upcoming Monday special: it marks the beginning of the Clarion (San Diego) Write-a-thon, and my one year anniversary of attending the Clarion Workshop. Clarion was a significant event in my life. One way I can give back is by participating in the write-a-thon and raising money to help the program that helped me. For six weeks, we learned to write better (but still shitty!) first drafts. I wrote three new stories at Clarion, and revised two previously written ones.</p>

      <p>Via Jim Kelly, by way of Tim Pratt, and because I am desperately avoiding the writing I need to do tonight, here are a few things I learned (or confirmed) while at Clarion. I write stories about the human condition. It&#8217;s the people that interest me, their struggles that move me, and their pain that moves my pen. So, I guess that explains my fascination with people-watching. Find what works for and stick with it.</p>

      <p>It&#8217;s a good feeling to put the word END after the last paragraph of a manuscript. This story was born week five of Clarion but I couldn&#8217;t make it work then. A little bit of time away and with four days of sporadic effort, it&#8217;s a story. Rough around the edges like any first draft but I expect those will be caught when I sent it to beta readers later this week.</p>

      <p>By Internet speeds, it&#8217;s been years since Clarion ended and not just a month. And the neglectful blogger I&#8217;ve been, it was six weeks before that since I last posted anything resembling an update. It&#8217;s time I said something, don&#8217;t you think? Well yes, but not exactly what you might expect. Eighteen people met as strangers in late June, in San Diego, and became a family. Along the way, aunts and uncles and cousins, and a grandfather or two, who guided us through the Clarion process.</p>

      <p>This will be my last communique for six weeks. Despite some weather delays in Chicago, I made it to San Diego and am ensconced on the UCSD campus. I&#8217;m as prepared as I can be for a very intense experience and that means throwing myself into it completely. No blogging, no LiveJournal or Facebook, nor Twitter. I will be in the dark until my return, so keep the joint in good shape until I&#8217;m back.</p>
