      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s now my second February living in southwest Ontario, with 50F weather and scattered rain showers. The snow, which didn&amp;#8217;t fall until mid-January, is a memory and it will be at least a week before we have any chance of seeing more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the hell, Canada?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people learned I was moving to Canada, I heard all kinds of jokes. Eh? Eh? One was about seeing moose, which I&amp;#8217;ve seen no trace of here but I have found in northern Wisconsin, where my Dad lives. There were comments about maple syrup, but again, Wisconsin, yo. Poutine. Oh, poutine. Yes, it&amp;#8217;s glorious. (No one warned me about milk in bags, though). And then I was warned about the cold, and the snow, and secretly, I looked forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, I grew up near Chicago and spent a few winters in the northwoods of Wisconsin. I have an idea of snow and cold can be, and this isn&amp;#8217;t either. True winter is letting the dog into the back yard and the dog disappearing, or looking out front after a fresh snowfall and the top of a snow drift being parallel to the top of the car. This year, I&amp;#8217;d be surprised if we&amp;#8217;ve had more than a foot of snowfall in total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not too late, Canada. I have faith. Drop some of that arctic chill down on us southern folk, harness some of that great lakes moisture, and give us a taste of a real winter.&lt;/p&gt;
