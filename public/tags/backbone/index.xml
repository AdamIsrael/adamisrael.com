      <description>Death comes to us all, eventually. It&amp;#8217;s a topic that artists have explored, he said tongue-in-cheek, to death.

Her posts on Ambiversion and the awesomeness of being an introvert kind of clued me in but her latest one about being less wishy-washy really hits home.</description>
