      <description>I felt a little blue this week, grousing over revisions and my sometimes fragile ego. I distracted myself by patiently refreshing the Writers of the Future blog and checking the mail every few minutes, hoping to see some word of the 2009 Q4 results. Well, the list of Honorable Mentions was released before they had a chance to update the blog.
 &amp;#8220;Out of the thousands of stories that get submitted to the contest, a small percentage make it this far,&amp;#8221; Wentworth continued.</description>

      <title>2009 Submission Statistics</title>

      <description>It wasn&amp;#8217;t the best year writing-wise. Eight new stories, one of which was flash and four were &amp;#8220;hint fiction&amp;#8221;. Two stories from 2008 were edited repeatedly and eventually submitted, both to Writers of the Future. Fifteen submissions, thirteen rejections, and one rewrite request. If my Duotope statistics are accurate, nine were personal rejections (one from a pro market).
Could be worse. 2010 will be much better, though.</description>
