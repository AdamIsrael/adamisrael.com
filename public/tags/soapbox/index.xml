      <description>It started with an announcement by Realms of Fantasy (RoF) magazine. A special themed issue. &amp;#8220;Girl writers only.&amp;#8221; A slight faux pas that was eventually correctly revised and apologized for. In the interim, some people were vocal about their discern that RoF would again make such a slip given the last gender-related fail. Catherine Valente, a well-respected writer, commented on the issue. She noted her take on the problem, and why she would rather see the issue of gender balance addressed in a smart way, not an appease-the-greasy-wheel way.</description>
