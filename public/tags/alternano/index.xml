      <description>November 1st is here and that means NaNoWriMo &amp;#8211; National Novel Writing Month. As someone who is a short story writer, I often look at my friends writing the long form with some envy. They have their own month and I don&amp;#8217;t want to be left out so I tell myself that I will finally write one of those novel ideas I&amp;#8217;ve been noodling on for forever. Just when I think I&amp;#8217;ve picked one and made a decision, the weight of my backlog of revisions, rewrites, or markets I want to submit to smacks me like a brick.</description>
