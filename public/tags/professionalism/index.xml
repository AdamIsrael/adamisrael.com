      <description>I sent a submission to a market whose name I will not reveal on July 15th. Acknowledgement was received on July 17th, which I&amp;#8217;ve included below, modified only to anonymize the publisher. There are enough mistakes contained in this experience that I think it&amp;#8217;s worth examining, both for writers, editors, and small press publishers.
 Thank you for your submission.
I expect to begin story review for Name Withheld in late July/early August and you should hear from me no later than September 15th.</description>
