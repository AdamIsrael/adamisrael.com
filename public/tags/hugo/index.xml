      <title>Migrating to Hugo</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;1&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;, the static website engine, not the &lt;a href=&#34;2&#34;&gt;award&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve grown frustrated with Wordpress and Dreamhost. Running a Wordpress site
on a shared web host is a ticking time bomb. More users crowded on a server. I
threw turned on caching and Cloudflare; readers should have had little trouble
using the site, but my sessions were consistently timing out while using the
admin dashboard, which makes posting new content a frustrating experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wordpress on it&amp;rsquo;s own is fine, especially on dedicated servers. I&amp;rsquo;ve run
hundreds of thousands of requests/day through Wordpress and it can handle it
well, as long as you give it the right hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dreamhost, as well, isn&amp;rsquo;t at fault. I pay for fairly cheap hosting, and they
don&amp;rsquo;t have much control over the efficiency of the apps that their shared
hosting customers run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in comes Hugo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of static site generators around, like jekyll or octopress. I
wanted to write in Markdown, I wanted it to be fast, and I wanted it to be
flexible. After playing around with a few generators, I was sold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can basically write a blog post really quick, save it, and run a script that
will generate the static pages, commit the changes to Github, and rsync it to
this site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may be a few formatting errors in the older posts, but I imported
everything from Wordpress, converted it to Markdown, and kept all of the
permalinks the same. All told, maybe twelve hours of work and I have a blog
I&amp;rsquo;m not frustrated to look at anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
