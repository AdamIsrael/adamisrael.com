      <description>I should have known I was in for a rough day when I woke up to rain. Not that rain is unusual, but I&amp;#8217;d never seen it rain in Santa Monica before. It was a nice rain, though, the kind that you don&amp;#8217;t mind walking to work in. After a weekend spent riding buses and enjoying the company of good friends (not that I&amp;#8217;m complaining), I found myself in a deficit of spoons, though.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s a good feeling to put the word END after the last paragraph of a manuscript. This story was born week five of Clarion but I couldn&amp;#8217;t make it work then. A little bit of time away and with four days of sporadic effort, it&amp;#8217;s a story. Rough around the edges like any first draft but I expect those will be caught when I sent it to beta readers later this week.</description>

      <description>Project: Sex/magic story, now with more poly love, a plump dominatrix, a Chicago swinger&amp;#8217;s club, and one pissed off magician.
New words written: 1,210
Reason for stopping: End of scene
One more scene left before I can make draft, so I&amp;#8217;m on target to wrap this up by the end of the weekend. Today&amp;#8217;s been upside down thanks to insomnia but I don&amp;#8217;t mind the word count. It&amp;#8217;ll be nice to get back to regular sleep schedule, though.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been a little slow getting back into the habit of writing new words since I&amp;#8217;ve been back from Clarion. Besides catching up on ye olde day job, I&amp;#8217;ve been working on revisions and submissions, organizing my inventory list, and other life issues.
Most of the stories in my backlog are either trunked, needing rewrites, or massive revision. Unfortunate, but them&amp;#8217;s the breaks. Not including the current work(s) in progress, there are:</description>

      <title>Week 2: A step slightly staggered</title>
      <link>http://adamisrael.com/blog/2010/01/16/week-2-a-step-slightly-staggered/</link>

      <description>A new short story and a flash fiction drafted, and a second short story underway. Over 7,500 new words this year, with my average rising to 509 words/day. The Honorable Mention nod and a personal rejection also came in. The year is off to a good start.
I&amp;#8217;m still struggling with revisions. I failed my weekly goals this week, getting almost no editing done nor my outline for the Dollhouse essay.</description>

      <title>2009 Submission Statistics</title>
      <link>http://adamisrael.com/blog/2010/01/01/2009-submission-statistics/</link>

      <description>It wasn&amp;#8217;t the best year writing-wise. Eight new stories, one of which was flash and four were &amp;#8220;hint fiction&amp;#8221;. Two stories from 2008 were edited repeatedly and eventually submitted, both to Writers of the Future. Fifteen submissions, thirteen rejections, and one rewrite request. If my Duotope statistics are accurate, nine were personal rejections (one from a pro market).
Could be worse. 2010 will be much better, though.</description>
