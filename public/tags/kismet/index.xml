      <description>Fate. Destiny. The word Kismet is the Turkish word to describe something I don&amp;#8217;t normally lend much weight to. Sometimes things happen, though. A completely random series of events that leads to something wonderful and there&amp;#8217;s no better way to describe it.
Yesterday started off kind of shitty. I was already in a bad mood, thanks to the Sunday dinner with family that ended in a bullying event by an asshole uncle-in-law that left me with back spasms, followed by a shredded tire on the borrowed truck driven by my brother-in-law that should never have been driven in the condition it was in.</description>
