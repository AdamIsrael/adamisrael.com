      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fate. Destiny. The word Kismet is the Turkish word to describe something I don&amp;#8217;t normally lend much weight to. Sometimes things happen, though. A completely random series of events that leads to something wonderful and there&amp;#8217;s no better way to describe it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday started off kind of shitty. I was already in a bad mood, thanks to the Sunday dinner with family that ended in a bullying event by an asshole uncle-in-law that left me with back spasms, followed by a shredded tire on the borrowed truck driven by my brother-in-law that should never have been driven in the condition it was in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went out for a few hours, hoping to get some editing done, but I was mad. Stewing, you know? I got home and just about lost my shit. Our bedroom has been refuge to just about everything since last year&amp;#8217;s basement flood, not to mention my feather pillows have gone beyond their best use by date. Apparently, when I get really angry I morph into Mega Maid. I didn&amp;#8217;t just clean. &lt;em&gt;Neigh&lt;/em&gt;. I cleansed. With holy fire. And lo, it was righteous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I emerged, several hours later and popped the last two decongestants. Sinus was plugged up, yo. The drug store was closing in 20 minutes, but it was also Canadian Thanksgiving so I realized it was a crapshoot but we&amp;#8217;re kind of dependent on the goo-remover so I put on pants and Andrea dutifully followed along to keep me from making a run for the border. The drug store, as I feared, was closed. Uptown it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live in a small town, but the grocery store started staying open &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; recently. As we walked by the accompanying greenhouse filled with bales of hay and piles of pumpkins, something moved out of the darkness towards us. A young cat, not in the least bit skittish, but curious. Andrea picked it up and her first words were, &amp;#8220;Don&amp;#8217;t worry, we&amp;#8217;ll take it to the shelter in the morning.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do our shopping, and call ahead to have the dogs put outside before we get home. We let the kitty, a girl, explore a little bit while we figure out logistics for the night. We need to segregate, and our bedroom makes the most sense. Hey, lucky for us it&amp;#8217;s just been cleaned. Fresh litter, a little bit of food and water, and she&amp;#8217;s acclimating nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrea and I settle in for bed. It takes me a while to doze off with this tiny fuzzball exploring the dark world around us but I finally do. I wake up a few hours later with her as limp as a warm sock, stretched out across my throat. Purring. She wakes, and we spent the next couple hours playing, until she curls up again and nods off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-606&#34; title=&#34;Kismet&#34; src=&#34;http://www.adamisrael.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/421289530.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;478&#34; height=&#34;640&#34; srcset=&#34;//www.adamisrael.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/421289530-224x300.jpg 224w, //www.adamisrael.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/421289530.jpg 478w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px&#34; /&gt;][1]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#8217;d like to introduce you to Kismet. We&amp;#8217;re not sure how old she is yet but she&amp;#8217;s the most charming little gal. She likes to cuddle and lick fingers. We&amp;#8217;ll take a trip to the vet soon to make sure no one else is missing her (I&amp;#8217;ve already checked for missing signs near where we found her). Otherwise, I think she&amp;#8217;s found herself a nice place to call home, and at a very appropriate moment.&lt;/p&gt;
