      <description>I&amp;#8217;m off to Chicago for another day of work meetings and decided to give the WordPress iPhone app a try. Not bad so far.
I spent several years working downtown in the late nineties so going back via train is always a bit nostalgic. I made a few transient friends along the way &amp;#8212; names forgotten but faces that will always be familiar.
Walking through the tall marble white walls in Union Station&amp;#8217;s grand ballroom or its darker coridoors I catch the scent of popcorn and it takes me back in time to those younger days.</description>
