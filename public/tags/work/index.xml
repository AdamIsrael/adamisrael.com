      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m off to Chicago for another day of work meetings and decided to give the WordPress iPhone app a try. Not bad so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent several years working downtown in the late nineties so going back via train is always a bit nostalgic. I made a few transient friends along the way &amp;#8212; names forgotten but faces that will always be familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking through the tall marble white walls in Union Station&amp;#8217;s grand ballroom or its darker coridoors I catch the scent of popcorn and it takes me back in time to those younger days. In some ways I am that same person, full of curiosity and wonder. The decade has changed me for the worse, too. I&amp;#8217;m more distrusting, more likely to question motive and intent. The saddest thing for me is I can&amp;#8217;t decide if that&amp;#8217;s really a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nostalgia brings us back to older days, but not always better days. As much as I&amp;#8217;d like my innocence back, bitter experience is a shield that protects us from self-inflicted harm. A sheltered life isn&amp;#8217;t really living, is it?&lt;/p&gt;
