      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve owned one electric razor in my life. It didn&amp;#8217;t do a great job of shaving my face and cleaning it out was a pain in the ass. I&amp;#8217;ve been using a disposable instead (one of those three-razor things) but replacement blades are expensive and the entire process annoys me. I&amp;#8217;m wondering if that electric razor I tried before just wasn&amp;#8217;t that good? So, to try out this nifty polling plugin, a question!</description>
