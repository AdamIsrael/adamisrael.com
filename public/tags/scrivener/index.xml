      <description>For the past few years, I&amp;#8217;ve had to manually update the contact information in the header of every Scrivener project I&amp;#8217;ve created. It was defaulting to an old email and physical address, but somehow had the correct phone number.
Scrivener can pull your contact information from the OS X application Contacts, if you add the string &amp;#8220;(Scrivener:UseMe)&amp;#8221; to the notes of your contact card. As it turns out, I had done that already but my card has all of my email addresses (work and home) as well as my current and past physical addresses.</description>

Ideally, I&amp;#8217;d like to average 1,000 words/day. That&amp;#8217;d be awesome. Life creeps up, with unavoidable things like responsibility and sleep but I have a secret that I&amp;#8217;ll share with you.</description>

      <description>The last few days haven&amp;#8217;t been the most productive ones. If I were to go by the official NaNoWriMo stats, my current estimated finish date is December 4th and I just won&amp;#8217;t accept that. There are weekends, holidays, and writing sprints between now and then. Anything can happen.
I stick to the time zone deadline pretty strictly, so I logged my numbers but kept writing and added another thousand words before bed.</description>
