      <title>The doppelgänger effect</title>

      <description>Yesterday was a travel day, coming home from a week in Breckenridge, CO for a work sprint. These are usually uneventful days, riding trains or shuttles to and from airports. Yesterday was different, though. Yesterday, I ran into my doppelgänger.
The first indication that something was off was when I checked my bag curbside. The porter asked me if I&amp;#8217;d already checked a bag. I said no, and he gestured me to come around the counter and see what he was seeing.</description>

      <description>So, due to timing of unfortunate circumstances, it&amp;#8217;s become rather convenient for me to go to Ad Astra, April 13-15th. This will, notably, be my first convention since moving to Canada.
I&amp;#8217;m relatively new to both country and the local genre community. I know there are a few members of Codex going and I recognize a few names from the panelist list (including Ed Greenwood, who was very kind towards a 19-year old me at Gen Con Milwaukee some years ago) but I&amp;#8217;m otherwise winging this.</description>

      <title>Recapping Toronto</title>

      <description>We went to Toronto last week. Sort of a mini-vacation. We planned the trip around a few events and winged the rest. We didn&amp;#8217;t realize the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) was happening, which sort of made finding last minute hotel rooms an adventure.
We headed up Sunday, with an all too brief stopover along the way to meet up with twitter pal SheikYurbouti, followed by a mad rush to make it downtown in time for the first of our first of three Pearl Jam concerts.</description>

      <title>Rainforest Writers Village</title>

      <description>Last weekend, Andrea and I attended the Rainforest Writers Village at Lake Quinalt in western Washington state. It was our first trip together in more than two years, the first time either of us had been to the Pacific Northwest, and our first to the states since my return to Canada last year.
My hat goes off to Patrick Swenson, who puts heart and soul into making the retreat an awesome event.</description>

      <title>Into the urban jungle</title>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m off to Chicago for another day of work meetings and decided to give the WordPress iPhone app a try. Not bad so far.
I spent several years working downtown in the late nineties so going back via train is always a bit nostalgic. I made a few transient friends along the way &amp;#8212; names forgotten but faces that will always be familiar.
Walking through the tall marble white walls in Union Station&amp;#8217;s grand ballroom or its darker coridoors I catch the scent of popcorn and it takes me back in time to those younger days.</description>

      <description>There’s so much that’s happened in the last twenty-four hours that I scarcely know where to start. For the uninitiated, I am American and my wife, Andrea, is Canadian. I have a house in Illinois, empty and for sale by court order from a previous marriage. In August of last year, my wife and I moved in with her Mom in Ontario, Canada. Prior that we had been living with my Dad in Wisconsin, in his three bedroom trailer, with our three large dogs and four cats, helping him recover from major back surgery.</description>

      <description>Writing It&amp;#8217;s really too early to tell how things are going to work out long-term but so far I feel good. Not overwhelmed by keeping my spreadsheets updated or gut checking my short-term goals. I&amp;#8217;m right where I want to be. I hope I can say the same thing a week and a month from now.

I&amp;#8217;m writing a little bit every day. I&amp;#8217;ve surpassed my 250 words/day goal.</description>
