      <description>Insomnia and I are old friends who nod in passing, acknowledging our shared history like lovers but say nothing. The latest flare of pain caused by fibromyalgia has rekindled that flame and brought an entirely new facet to the relationship.
Fibro flares can be difficult. It&amp;#8217;s sometimes easy to forget I&amp;#8217;m in the middle of one when I&amp;#8217;m sitting and working or active around the house but when I lay down to rest and my body starts to relax the pain gets worse.</description>

      <description>This was a good news/bad news kind of week on the medical front. I wish I had more energy to talk about it, but I am running low on spoons and need to conserve them.
Good news:
 Kidneys and Thyroid are normal.   It’s not Multiple Sclerosis.   It’s probably not Lupus.   The bad news:
 There is still a chance it could be Lupus, so I had more blood drawn to confirm/deny.</description>
