      <description>The package of mail from the states that I&amp;#8217;ve been anxiously waiting for arrived today. I now have the last of the paperwork I need to continue with my permanent residence application, my Square reader, so I can accept credit card payments, and the sealed letter from the Illinois DMV so I can get my Ontario drivers license.
We drive to the nearest driving center with the sealed letter in hand.</description>
