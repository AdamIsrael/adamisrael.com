      <description>Andrea and I drove up to Toronto &amp;#8212; or Richmond Hill, one of its northern suburbs &amp;#8212; for World Fantasy 2012 on Friday. This was my second World Fantasy (the first being Columbus two years ago) and Andrea&amp;#8217;s first.
The hotel(s):
We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express, one of the overflow hotels. That hotel itself was pleasant, albiet slightly incompetent. One elevator was out of order the entire stay. Andrea was trapped between floors in the second elevator on Saturday and had to be rescued by the fire department.</description>

      <title>Ad Astra Wrapup</title>

      <description>My first Ad Astra is over, and I didn&amp;#8217;t completely embarrass myself. Huzzah!
I&amp;#8217;ll admit to being intimidated at first, not knowing anyone. It&amp;#8217;s a good-sized local convention with a lot of history and people know already each other. What I finally realized, though, is that I just needed to _politely_ join in the conversation. Everyone was welcoming and, even better, assumed I was Canadian. I swear, I am in all but name.</description>

      <title>Going to Ad Astra 2012</title>

      <description>So, due to timing of unfortunate circumstances, it&amp;#8217;s become rather convenient for me to go to Ad Astra, April 13-15th. This will, notably, be my first convention since moving to Canada.
I&amp;#8217;m relatively new to both country and the local genre community. I know there are a few members of Codex going and I recognize a few names from the panelist list (including Ed Greenwood, who was very kind towards a 19-year old me at Gen Con Milwaukee some years ago) but I&amp;#8217;m otherwise winging this.</description>

      <description>We spent the better part of this week in Toronto &amp;#8212; an impromptu trip after receiving a call with some concerning medical news on Sunday night. So, for the first half of the week we’ve explored the inner workings of the Toronto hospital system. As someone who more or less grew up inside hospitals, I’ve made some observations:
 Whoever is running the parking system is making a killing. We spent as much on parking as we did on food for two.</description>

      <title>Brief World Fantasy wrap-up</title>

      <description>I went to my first World Fantasy Convention last weekend. I&amp;#8217;ve been to other conventions &amp;#8212; mostly smaller, regional conventions like Penguicon, Windycon, and a one-day stop at WisCon last year. I thought I knew what to expect. Boy was I wrong.
First, the new friends. So many of my friends converged upon Columbus that World Fantasy was, for many of us, our first face-to-face meeting. I met what seemed like half of my rival Clarion class, all but one of the Inkpunks (Wendy, we missed you dearly), and so many others from Facebook, Twitter, and LiveJournal.</description>
