      <description>GO and OS X I&amp;#8217;m doing a little hacking with juju actions before they land in a stable release but I ran into some hurdles getting Go working with the brew-installed version. Trying to install Go packages failed with a bunch of &amp;#8216;unrecognized import path&amp;#8217; errors. Here&amp;#8217;s how I fixed it.
STOP, GO, STOP Even though you can install Go via brew, there&amp;#8217;s more to be done to get it working.</description>
