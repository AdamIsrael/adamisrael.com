      <description>The package of mail from the states that I&amp;#8217;ve been anxiously waiting for arrived today. I now have the last of the paperwork I need to continue with my permanent residence application, my Square reader, so I can accept credit card payments, and the sealed letter from the Illinois DMV so I can get my Ontario drivers license.
We drive to the nearest driving center with the sealed letter in hand.</description>

      <description>Writing It&amp;#8217;s really too early to tell how things are going to work out long-term but so far I feel good. Not overwhelmed by keeping my spreadsheets updated or gut checking my short-term goals. I&amp;#8217;m right where I want to be. I hope I can say the same thing a week and a month from now.

I&amp;#8217;m writing a little bit every day. I&amp;#8217;ve surpassed my 250 words/day goal.</description>
