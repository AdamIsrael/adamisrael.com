          <h4>Finding my footing</h4>
          <p>
          
            
              <a href="http://dev.adamisrael.com//categories/writing/">Writing</a>
            
           
          </p>
          <p><p>As writers, we fill our toolbox with things that help us in our craft. I&#8217;ve been experimenting with a few new things of late, trying to boost my productivity. Two of them in particular are making a difference.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t been involved in many word wars &#8212; timed writing sessions with one or more other writers. Set a short time limit, say 15 or 30 minutes, and write until it&#8217;s over. I started doing that last week, with my online writers group, and had one of my most productive days. These sprints are like a mini-deadline and it&#8217;s easier at times to shut out distraction in small increments. To that end, I&#8217;m taking carving out small small blocks of time throughout the day to write, especially on days when I might not be able to dedicate an hour or two contiguously. I&#8217;m going to get an egg timer to give me an external countdown to the process as well.</p>

<p>I ordered a cute egg timer from the states, but it was broken and I discovered the hard way how expensive custom and duty fees can be when something is shipped via UPS cross-border. I may just find a decent kitchen timer that can do double-duty.</p>

<p>The second trick is an organizational one. I&#8217;ve seen it <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5968978/use-the-dash-method-to-become-a-better-writer-developer-or-tackle-any-other-creative-task">referred to</a> as the DASH method &#8212; Direction, Acceleration, Strength, and Health.</p>

<p>Direction is knowing what I&#8217;m going to write before I start. I make short lists of every chapter, broken down by scene, of what that writing needs to accomplish, usually no more than four or five bullet points. That mini-outline forces me to think through every chapter before I put down a single word. When I do sit down to write, I know what my end goal is.</p>

<p>Acceleration is getting started and finishing things. I&#8217;ve been pretty slow, plodding along and being frustrated with my progress. I would take so long, writing and rewriting, that I made almost no progress. Now, almost as a mantra, I remind myself that the point of a first draft is getting the ideas down on the page. Making the grammar fluid and pretty can wait for revision.</p>

<p>Strength refers to bolstering your mental clarify and physical strength through a better working environment. I am all about that. It&#8217;s been a slow process to make my office a comfortable space but we&#8217;re almost there. We have our bookshelves up and my cork board, filled with quotes that inspire, hands next to my desk. When I do need a change of pace, I switch to the coffee shop up the road.</p>

<p>Health is a reminder to take care of myself. Figuring out what doesn&#8217;t work (and drives up anxiety) and fix it. Get enough sleep. Realize that if I&#8217;m stuck on something, I probably just need to work it through to figure out what I&#8217;m missing &#8212; brainstorming, doodling, talking it through with someone else.</p>

<p>Last week wasn&#8217;t the most productive, with a funeral, doctors visit, and other distractions, but I had two great days.</p>

<p>Project: Black Mirror</p>

<p>New words written since last week: 1,980</p>

<p>Average words/day: 248</p>

<p>![][2]</p>

<p>I&#8217;m working through some existing scenes that need at least some work vs. writing new words. It&#8217;s slowed me down a little but it needs doing. I&#8217;m printing off each chapter as it&#8217;s finished and putting it into a binder. When I do finish, I&#8217;ll take that binder and a red pen and go sit somewhere for an afternoon and begin the revision process. Until then, the printed manuscript goes and is another reminder of what I&#8217;ve finished so far.</p>
