          <p><p>The <a href="1">Spoon Theory</a> became very real for me earlier this year. Along with all of the other challenges, getting into Clarion almost seemed more a curse than a blessing at times.</p>

  My friend John, who started Clarion West tonight, wanted to know where he could mail something to me so it would reach me before I left for Clarion. The package arrived a few days ago.

<p>Inside the box was a book:</p>

<p>And behold! 42 spoons, some bearing quotes of imagination, wonder, and inspiration. Someone out there knows of or shares my fondness for Kahlil Gibran.</p>

<p>Finish Things</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There aren&#8217;t many things happening these days that I&#8217;d consider easy. Being separated from Andrea is just about the hardest thing I&#8217;ve had to deal with. It&#8217;s a daily stress that weighs on me every day, and the uncertainty of when we will see each other again makes it almost unbearable. Having Clarion ahead is almost a guilt to face; a giant what-if. If I hadn&#8217;t gotten in to Clarion, all of my excess energies would be spent on getting home to her and that&#8217;s hard on the both of us.</p>

<p>I bear the guilt alone. I chose to apply, knowing the possibilities, however remote I thought they were that I&#8217;d get in. I knew that six weeks separation would be difficult for us but that it would be for our greater good. I didn&#8217;t expect for it to balloon this much. With the time away helping my mom after her surgery, we&#8217;ll have spent at least three months apart this year.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful then the risk it took to blossom. &#8211; Anais Nin</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I dream of a day, hopefully not too far off, when all of my debts are paid and behind me and Andrea and I finally have a place to call our own. The yard is fenced in so the dogs can roam freely and play. There&#8217;s a gazebo out back where we enjoy the summer weather and a grill where we cook, and a hammock where I nap when the breeze is just nice.</p>

<p>Inside, we have adjacent offices where we work during the days. We&#8217;ll break for lunches together and share kitchen duty, and enjoy relaxing evenings together. If there is any travel to be done, it&#8217;s either a very short work trip or something planned that the both of us take together. There&#8217;ll be no more of this separation bullshit. If health, genetics, and luck are in our favor, we&#8217;ll litter the place with kids and turn them into geeks and nerds to plague the earth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I must not fear.</p>

<p>Fear is the mind-killer.</p>

<p>Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.</p>

<p>I will face my fear.</p>

<p>I will permit it to pass over me and through me.</p>

<p>And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.</p>

<p>Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.</p>

<p>Only I will remain.</p>

<p>Thank you, friends, for your spoons and your thoughts. They bring me comfort and peace.</p>
