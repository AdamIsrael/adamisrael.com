          <h4>Storylife — A process of wrangling submissions</h4>
          <p>

              <a href="http://adamisrael.com//categories/writing/">Writing</a>
            
           
          </p>
          <p><p>I just mailed off my first story submission since 2009. Most of my submissions are electronic but, dating back to my first submissions circa 2007, I think I&#8217;ve mailed off 5 or 6 stories or about 5% of my total submissions.</p>

<p>Some writers don&#8217;t even own printers ([John Scalzi][1] comes to mind). Markets are evolving &#8212; not quite matching pace, but at least trailing the pack. Analog and Asimov both use the electronic submissions system developed by Neil Clarke. I&#8217;ve always had a printer &#8212; usually one, a trusty laser dedicated to printing manuscripts &#8212; because I like marking up hard copy but I&#8217;m economical when it comes to submissions and response time.</p>

<p>Every story has a life. Literally, in my case. Recently, I built a spreadsheet called Storylife where every story has a sheet of its own. In it, I track the where the story is gone and where the story is going next. Every new sheet is seeded with a list of pro markets that I&#8217;ve created based on an analysis of my own submission records, SFWA qualifying markets, and my own reading. It&#8217;s a who&#8217;s who of where I&#8217;d like to be published. That initial list gets culled of markets that don&#8217;t fit the story and sorted by best fit and response time. Non-pro markets get added to that list as I near the end.</p>

<p>Most of the markets take electronic subs, but there are a few that don&#8217;t. Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction. Interzone. Black Static. Black Gate. Lady Churchill&#8217;s Rosebud Wristlet. With Storylife, I&#8217;m making myself submit to those markets even though it&#8217;s a little less convenient than usual. F&amp;SF is the outlier in terms of response time; they&#8217;re faster than most of their electronic counterparts. With the rest, factoring in transit time, you&#8217;re looking at maybe two or three months, if you&#8217;re lucky.</p>

<p>For me, the decision to submit by mail comes down to measuring the odds, which involves a little bit of rejectomancy. I don&#8217;t submit a story until I&#8217;m reasonably confident in it and the first few markets I send it out to are electronic with a quick turnaround time. If I get straight up form rejections in the average response time, I might take another look to see what might be keeping me in the slush pile before sending it back out. If I get a string of &#8220;close, but not quite&#8221; rejections then I feel as reasonably sure as any doubting writer can that the story just needs to find the right editor and I&#8217;ll make the investment to submit by mail.</p>

<p>There are financial logistics involved in deciding to submit by mail. Mailing from Canada to the US cost me $8.57 today, just in postage. It would have been cheaper if I&#8217;d had US postage &#8212; $0.88 for two stamps vs. $4.50 for an International Relay Coupon &#8212; but getting stamps takes a little maneuvering. Add in the cost of the 9&#215;12 and business size envelope, printing, etc.</p>

<p>Speaking of story life, I also need to make a decision about shelf life. I&#8217;m considering following Ferrett&#8217;s lead where he called a mulligan on his pre-Clarion writing life. I still have some of those stories in circulation and while they&#8217;re good stories, I am running out of places to send them despite mostly positive feedback. Maybe harvest the ideas in future stories, because when you compare that to what I&#8217;ve written since Clarion, nine first drafts, five polished stories sent out on submission and three sold (60%), all on their first date, that tells me I should be expending my energy on the new things. I have a feeling that there&#8217;s a diminishing point of return on old stories, where they might do more harm than good in the eyes of an editor. I&#8217;m just not sure where to draw that line.</p>
