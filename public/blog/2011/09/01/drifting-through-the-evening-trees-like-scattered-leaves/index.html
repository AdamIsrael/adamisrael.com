          <p><p>August, blessedly, is over.</p>

<p>Besides the heat, humidity, and histamine that&#8217;s kept me inside for most of the month, I shouldn&#8217;t complain too much. I watched my <a href="1">friends get married</a> via Google Handout. The car broke down, requiring a tow and new battery. I watched Life on Mars (the UK version) and Andrea and I finally caught up on Fringe.</p>

<p>Life on Mars &#8212; what a fabulous idea. Now that I&#8217;ve seen both the US and original UK versions I feel like I should say something about it. I&#8217;m missing a lot of the popular culture references that might make the viewing experience of the original version a little different. The US version hooked me emotionally from the start but the ending fell flat, while the UK version started slower but had such a powerful ending. It disheartens me that the decision was made to veer so far from the original ending, when they had been so true to the source. Choosing a favorite is hard; I&#8217;m going with the US version, a decision colored perhaps because I watched it first, but with the UK ending tacked on.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m officially past my one year Clarionversary now. I wrote one new story and rewrote another that had been sitting post-draft. Both are submitted to anthologies, one of which was by invitation. I&#8217;ve been taking stock of my inventory of stories, as I mentioned in my last post. I have something like twenty-two short stories waiting to be rewritten, revised or trunked. I want these stories to find a home, or at least get into a form that I&#8217;m not embarrassed to put them into circulation. To that end, I&#8217;m laying down an ultimatum: no more first drafts***** until I&#8217;ve whittled away at this stack.</p>

<p>Also, now that those two short story deadlines have been met I can now buckle down on the novel. I wasn&#8217;t sure which novel idea to work on so I asked Andrea. She&#8217;s my first reader for everything and, while she doesn&#8217;t always share my tastes I always value her opinion. She reminded me that it really comes down to what I&#8217;m passionate about. My bookshelf is filled with the proof. Graphic novels like Preacher, Hellboy, Sandman, and Constantine. Non-fiction books about Freemasonry, the magick of Aleister Crowley, the <a href="2">Book of Lies: The Disinformation Guide to Magick and the Occult</a>, the dark history of Popes, the biography of <a href="3">Olimpia Maidalchini</a>, advisor to and considered by some to be the true power behind Pope Innocent X, Aldous Huxley&#8217;s The Devils of Loudon. Clearly my tastes run along a certain bent and I should run with it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been noodling around with this idea for years. <a href="4">History of the Flesh</a>, my flash fiction piece coming out in the upcoming <a href="5">Crimson Pact</a> 2 anthology, is set in the same world. It&#8217;s kind of like John Constantine meets Indiana Jones and Harry Dresden. It&#8217;s dark and gritty but smart and I can&#8217;t wait to get it started.</p>

<p>September&#8217;s shaping up to be a good month. Plus, we&#8217;re heading to Toronto in a couple weeks to see Pearl Jam and maybe catch a baseball game. Not a bad life at all.</p>
