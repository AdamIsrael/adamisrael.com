      <p>By Internet speeds, it&#8217;s been years since Clarion ended and not just a month. And the neglectful blogger I&#8217;ve been, it was six weeks before that since I last posted anything resembling an update. It&#8217;s time I said something, don&#8217;t you think? Well yes, but not exactly what you might expect.
Eighteen people met as strangers in late June, in San Diego, and became a family. Along the way, aunts and uncles and cousins, and a grandfather or two, who guided us through the Clarion process.</p>

      <p>This will be my last communique for six weeks. Despite some weather delays in Chicago, I made it to San Diego and am ensconced on the UCSD campus. I&#8217;m as prepared as I can be for a very intense experience and that means throwing myself into it completely. No blogging, no LiveJournal or Facebook, nor Twitter. I will be in the dark until my return, so keep the joint in good shape until I&#8217;m back.</p>

      <p>The Spoon Theory became very real for me earlier this year. Along with all of the other challenges, getting into Clarion almost seemed more a curse than a blessing at times.

      <p>Guess what? I feel better. Better than I have in five years or so. What changed? Interesting, that&#8230;
A couple weeks ago, I decided to do a reboot of the diet. My reading on Fibromyalgia led me to discussions of Celiac disease and how much of an overlap there is between the two. I figured that going back to a basic diet of protein, vegetable, and fruit for a week or two would be a good reset.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;m off to Chicago for another day of work meetings and decided to give the WordPress iPhone app a try. Not bad so far.
I spent several years working downtown in the late nineties so going back via train is always a bit nostalgic. I made a few transient friends along the way &#8212; names forgotten but faces that will always be familiar.
Walking through the tall marble white walls in Union Station&#8217;s grand ballroom or its darker coridoors I catch the scent of popcorn and it takes me back in time to those younger days.</p>

      <p>This was a good news/bad news kind of week on the medical front. I wish I had more energy to talk about it, but I am running low on spoons and need to conserve them.
Good news:
 Kidneys and Thyroid are normal.   It’s not Multiple Sclerosis.   It’s probably not Lupus.   The bad news:
 There is still a chance it could be Lupus, so I had more blood drawn to confirm/deny.</p>

      <p>I had hopefully one of the last post-divorce court dates this morning. Nothing terribly surprising came out of it. Judge says I need to pay my ex’s lawyer fees since I didn’t meet the original terms of the agreement (to which my attorney still argues was an impossibility). That’s a hard lesson chalked up to experience. Never be afraid to question your lawyer, or fire them, if you don’t think they have your best interest at heart.</p>

      <p>I’ve spent the last few days in a work and stress-induced fugue state, trying to wrap my head around things. Andrea and family went to meet with our immigration person on Monday. The only sure way that I’ll be allowed back into Canada is for us to file for immigration first. That sounds easier and quicker than it actually is. We’re facing up to a few months before that can happen.</p>

      <p>I spent the weekend in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where the day job graciously put me up in a hotel in exchange for some long and late work hours. On Saturday I went to the Arbor Brewing Company on the recommendation of a friend, both for a change of scenery and because I have not been eating much of anything since the whole border ordeal went down.
I sat in a window booth, watching the wind blow and the rain drive down on hapless pedestrians as I hacked away at the keyboard.</p>
