      <p>I&#8217;m trying to do a better job of writing every day, getting things done, and keeping to a schedule. This might not be of interest to anyone else, but public shaming accountability keeps me honest. Projects: Motown Blues (tentative) New words written: 571 Reason for stopping: End of scene Even though I know exactly where the story is headed, it&#8217;s fun to discover the bits that jump out of the ether, waving their arms and screaming, &#8220;hey, look at me!!&#8221;.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;d ask Neil Gaiman this himself (and yes, I know I&#8217;ve tagged him on Twitter on the off chance he sees this), but he&#8217;s a busy guy and the odds of getting a chance to talk to him are, frankly, bewilderingly astronomical. I&#8217;ll throw this question out to everyone because I&#8217;m genuinely curious to hear more thoughts on this. At Clarion last year, I wrote a short story inspired by Norse mythology, set in America.</p>

      <p>Six years ago, I was a freelance software engineer, with a background in advertising, search engines and high-performance web applications, when an introductory email lead me to help build a new company. I was employee #1; I built a multi-million dollar ad serving platform from scratch and in the process I worked sales, accounting, administration, development, and management. In the end, though, there is something to be said about being your own man, being able to make decisions and see your visions to fruition.</p>

      <p>As far as I&#8217;m aware, this is my very first review. Extinct Doesn&#8217;t Mean Forever is an anthology of 19 stories exploring the concept of extinction, with genres ranging from far future SF to others that happily straddle the line between speculative fiction and the mainstream. &#8230; The second half of the book slows down somewhat. Some of the stories are longer and some of them frankly wear out their welcome.</p>

      <p>I alluded to some good news yesterday; the first piece of it is more or less final now. As of this morning, I am done with divorce court. I have two months of maintenance (alimony) and lawyer fees left to pay and this will be a memory. 3 years, 2 months, 30 days 102,384,000 seconds 1,706,400 minutes 28,440 hours 169 weeks In the time it took for this ordeal to end , I could have walked 5,925 miles (assuming 5 miles/day), from the Pacific to Atlantic coast and back.</p>

      <p>&nbsp; I realize that I neglected to mention that the anthology Extinct Doesn&#8217;t Mean Forever, containing my story Indigo&#8217;s Gambit, is now available on Amazon. Three, two, one, bang — the Drifting Star skipped on the wave of a collapsing micro-sun, soaring through the void between the stars. The astronautical library contained surveys and charts on hundreds of thousands of star systems within the alliance of civilized worlds the Fringe called Sing Xu.</p>

      <p>Yes, I still suck at blogging regularly. I don&#8217;t expect that&#8217;ll change, but I sure keep trying. So, to catch you up on the life of Adam, here&#8217;s a quick rundown of what I&#8217;ve been up to. Achieved INBOX=0 and rocked the hell out of my calendar and TODO list. Yes, I might be micro-managing my time but it seems to be working. I&#8217;ve been more productive this last week than I have in the last few months, both personally and professionally.</p>

      <p>Last weekend, Andrea and I attended the Rainforest Writers Village at Lake Quinalt in western Washington state. It was our first trip together in more than two years, the first time either of us had been to the Pacific Northwest, and our first to the states since my return to Canada last year. My hat goes off to Patrick Swenson, who puts heart and soul into making the retreat an awesome event.</p>

      <p>Crossed Genres Superhero-themed issue is now available, including my story &#8220;Dog Days&#8220;. What a hell of a line-up, too. I&#8217;m sharing a table of contents with friend and Clarion West 2010 graduate Tracie Welser (How Molière Saved Lydia Bruer: A History in Two Fragments) and introduced me to Nathan Crowder (Hard Ride to Yuma), Leow Hui Min Annabeth (Idris on the Job) and KB Lawrence (Across the City’s Belly). All of this great fiction is topped off by As Weak as Women’s Magic, an article by Athena Andreadis.</p>

      <p>I missed seeing the last time you performed in Chicago. A client offered me tickets to see you and I scoffed. You, after all, were a country singer and I was too good for that; I&#8217;d rather listen to my heavy metal, thank you very much. So when I actually listened to your music for the first time, really listened, it was like you were speaking to me. I was hooked.</p>
