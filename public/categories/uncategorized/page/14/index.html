      <p>I&#8217;ve been sent word that I can publicly announce the news I&#8217;ve been sitting on since last week: I have been accepted into the 2010 Clarion Workshop. More later, after the celebration has ended.</p>

      <p>Believe it or not, I’m still a little under the weather. I’m beginning to suspect I had the hamthrax. Five weeks out and I’m just now starting to feel like myself again. All it really means is that I’m sleeping way more than usual, drinking a gallon of water a day, and a bit behind in my correspondence. So better late than never, I’m happy to announce that I’ve applied to Clarion and Clarion West.</p>

      <p>February is coming to a close and I&#8217;m scrambling like mad. Clarion closes to applications on March 1st. One application story is done. I have a second one more or less ready, but I&#8217;m debating a last minute replacement. I&#8217;m putting the grind wheel and polish to my as yet untitled story for the Scheherazade&#8217;s Facade anthology, due February 28th. It&#8217;s shaping up into something that makes me happy. I pushed myself when writing this and for that reason I&#8217;m also considering using it as my second Clarion story.</p>

      <p>My mom had reconstructive ankle surgery to correct some of long-term damage caused by polio so I spent the last few weeks with her, doing laundry and cooking and whatnot. I also took the opportunity to wear down my annual deductible and get a few lingering medical issues looked at. And while in Illinois, I picked up a rather nasty flu that has wiped me out completely. Most of the effects of the flu are gone, knock on wood.</p>

      <p>Not only is Kyle Cassidy a heck of a photographer, writer and teacher, he is also one hell of a nice guy. I had a lucky chance to meet and learn a few photography skills some months back. He learned that I was also a writer and offered to send me one of his extra fountain pens. I very nearly squeed. I&#8217;ve been interested in fountain pens for as long as I can remember.</p>

      <p>Week 4 ended on a bit of a downer. I&#8217;d been doing well, writing a bit each day but the streak came to an end. I drafted two short stories and three flash fiction. I started a fourth but it wasn&#8217;t ready to be told. Instead of forcing it, I skipped a day. Somewhere along the way, I caught a nice little cold/flu, was diagnosed with some vitamin deficiencies (insert scurvy joke here, matey) and started a few new prescribed drugs.</p>

      <p>Another kind of successful week &#8212; 3,237 new words, bringing the years total to 10,404. I&#8217;m still struggling with revisions. I got critiques back on two of my stories this week. The crits were brutally honest, the way I like them, and resonated with things I&#8217;d been trying to figure out myself. One thing I&#8217;m uncovering is that I don&#8217;t read critically enough. Having a third party point out an issue is great.</p>

      <p>Well no, because I&#8217;m not ready to talk about that just yet. Hershel posted his list of stuff he can&#8217;t live without the other day and it got me to thinking. I&#8217;ve learned a lot about myself and materialism over the past two years. I found that I don&#8217;t need a lot of stuff to be happy. Not that I&#8217;m a monk or anything but I&#8217;ve come to understand the &#8220;less is more&#8221; mentality.</p>

      <p>A new short story and a flash fiction drafted, and a second short story underway. Over 7,500 new words this year, with my average rising to 509 words/day. The Honorable Mention nod and a personal rejection also came in. The year is off to a good start. I&#8217;m still struggling with revisions. I failed my weekly goals this week, getting almost no editing done nor my outline for the Dollhouse essay.</p>
