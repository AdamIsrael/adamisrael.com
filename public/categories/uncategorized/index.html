      <p>There’s have been many kerfluffles involving the Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers Association (SFWA). The latest one begin when a former member began a petition over recent changes to the staff and policy of the organization’s flagship publication, the Bulletin. As a result of the current back and forth between factions, one member — a vocal minority — made the suggestion that the bar for membership should be raised. There’s a lot I could say about the current debate(s) going on, but I want to specifically address the idea of accessibility and diversity.</p>

      <p>Hark! Inconsistent blogger has returned with news! I am pleased to announce that I&#8217;ve sold &#8220;Aye of the Hagfish&#8221; to Goldfish Grimm&#8217;s Spicy Fiction Sushi. It should be appearing online early 2014. This will be my second appearance in the magazine (the first being Control, in their debut issue). I&#8217;m down to one story in circulation, and no new short stories finished this year, but for good reason! I finished the first draft, first read-through, and have begun developmental edits on the novel tentatively titled (but almost guaranteed to be renamed) &#8220;Black Mirror&#8221;.</p>

      <p>To be exact, it&#8217;s been 783 days since we filed for my Canadian Permanent Residence and I am happy to announce that it is official done. We have just walked out of the Immigration Centre in Windsor, Ontario, Social Insurance Number in hand. I guess this makes me an expatriate; an American Citizen permanently living abroad, which is kind of cool. I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about getting a tattoo to commemorate the experience.</p>

      <p>It should be no surprise to anyone who knows me that the Clarion Writers Workshop is a thing near and dear to me. Attending the six-week workshop in 2010 was a milestone in my writing career. The annual write-a-thon, where writers commit to writing goals and ask friends, family,and strangers to pledge money to go towards funding the workshop. Saying &#8220;please give money&#8221; is something I do on very rare occasion, but this is something worthwhile.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;ve always liked stories about mundane things. Everyday people who might be ignored or worse, shunned &#8212; garbage men, teachers, farmers, butchers, prostitutes, factory workers &#8212; who find themselves in extraordinary circumstance and rise up to the challenge. The annals of history are filled with stories of the famous, the successful, the victors. Finding tales about those broke their backs to make a living is harder. It&#8217;s not glamorous work. No one does it to become rich or powerful.</p>

      <p>For months, we kept the animated film &#8220;9&#8221; (2009) on the DVR. I kept telling myself that I&#8217;d sit down and watch it on the weekend, and inevitably being too distracted to do so. We came home a few nights ago and discovered the DVR had deleted several of the oldest recordings, including 9. That made me sad, because I really did intend on watching it soon. Kind of mad, I fired up Netflix and watched it that night.</p>

      <p>The calendar has been replaced. Sins of the past tallied and new resolutions made. As far as years go, 2012 was mediocre on many fronts but there were a few bright moments that give me hope for what&#8217;s to come. Home: When we moved out of our house to help my Dad after surgery in May of 2009, I could never have foreseen the journey ahead of us. Alone or apart, we&#8217;ve been staying with other people ever since.</p>

      <p>Andrea and I drove up to Toronto &#8212; or Richmond Hill, one of its northern suburbs &#8212; for World Fantasy 2012 on Friday. This was my second World Fantasy (the first being Columbus two years ago) and Andrea&#8217;s first. The hotel(s): We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express, one of the overflow hotels. That hotel itself was pleasant, albiet slightly incompetent. One elevator was out of order the entire stay. Andrea was trapped between floors in the second elevator on Saturday and had to be rescued by the fire department.</p>

      <p>I may burst with glee. Tomorrow is Nikola Tesla day. Today, the Mad Scientist Journal published my secret history of Tesla, &#8220;Man Out of Time&#8220;. I even have word that someone on Facebook commented that they thought the story was a &#8220;great idea to run a game/one-shot on&#8221;. Katie Nyborg did the fabulous illustration for the interior. How much does this mean to me? Well, Tesla is my hero more so than any other historical figure ever.</p>

That&#8217;d be awesome. Life creeps up, with unavoidable things like responsibility and sleep but I have a secret that I&#8217;ll share with you. Lean a little close. That&#8217;s it, just a little closer. It&#8217;s a little maddening to miss your goals.</p>
