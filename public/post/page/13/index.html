      <p>November 1st is here and that means NaNoWriMo &#8211; National Novel Writing Month. As someone who is a short story writer, I often look at my friends writing the long form with some envy. They have their own month and I don&#8217;t want to be left out so I tell myself that I will finally write one of those novel ideas I&#8217;ve been noodling on for forever. Just when I think I&#8217;ve picked one and made a decision, the weight of my backlog of revisions, rewrites, or markets I want to submit to smacks me like a brick.</p>

      <p>I should have known I was in for a rough day when I woke up to rain. Not that rain is unusual, but I&#8217;d never seen it rain in Santa Monica before. It was a nice rain, though, the kind that you don&#8217;t mind walking to work in. After a weekend spent riding buses and enjoying the company of good friends (not that I&#8217;m complaining), I found myself in a deficit of spoons, though.</p>

      <p>It&#8217;s a good feeling to put the word END after the last paragraph of a manuscript. This story was born week five of Clarion but I couldn&#8217;t make it work then. A little bit of time away and with four days of sporadic effort, it&#8217;s a story. Rough around the edges like any first draft but I expect those will be caught when I sent it to beta readers later this week.</p>

New words written: 1,210 Reason for stopping: End of scene One more scene left before I can make draft, so I&#8217;m on target to wrap this up by the end of the weekend. Today&#8217;s been upside down thanks to insomnia but I don&#8217;t mind the word count. It&#8217;ll be nice to get back to regular sleep schedule, though.</p>

      <p>One good thing, maybe the only good thing, about being so far removed from friends and family is that there isn&#8217;t much social life to speak of. That means on Friday night, after a post-work nap, I made some serious story progress. If all goes according to plan, I&#8217;ll make draft on this by the end of the weekend. Next I only need a title. Project: Tantric sex/magic story, now with more poly love, a plump dominatrix, a Chicago swinger&#8217;s club, and one pissed off magician.</p>

      <p>This cold/sinus/allergy thing that&#8217;s been sneaking its way into my head has finally arrived, triggering a slight fibro flare and a pretty good ear infection to boot. That cut my writing time short tonight and ended with me foggy enough that I left the drug store with cough medicine, not the cough and cold I meant to pick up.

      <p>I&#8217;ve been a little slow getting back into the habit of writing new words since I&#8217;ve been back from Clarion. Besides catching up on ye olde day job, I&#8217;ve been working on revisions and submissions, organizing my inventory list, and other life issues. Most of the stories in my backlog are either trunked, needing rewrites, or massive revision. Unfortunate, but them&#8217;s the breaks. Not including the current work(s) in progress, there are: 35 stories 110,418 words 3,150 average words/story 3 sold 7 trunked 1 blogged 11 needing revision 11 needing a rewrite 2 on submission I have two new stories in the works.</p>

      <p>Happy fifth birthday to Hadley Rille Books, who published my first in print story. They publish many fine books and anthologies, so please consider supporting this great small press. Today is release day for Rigor Amortis, edited by Jaym Gates and Erika Holt, and containing stories by R. Schuyler Devin, Kaolin Imago Fire, Kay T. Holt, John Nakamura Remy, Andrew Penn Romine, Wendy N. Wagner, and many others.

      <p>By Internet speeds, it&#8217;s been years since Clarion ended and not just a month. And the neglectful blogger I&#8217;ve been, it was six weeks before that since I last posted anything resembling an update. It&#8217;s time I said something, don&#8217;t you think? Well yes, but not exactly what you might expect. Eighteen people met as strangers in late June, in San Diego, and became a family. Along the way, aunts and uncles and cousins, and a grandfather or two, who guided us through the Clarion process.</p>
