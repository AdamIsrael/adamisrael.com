      <p>Yesterday was the fourteenth day of Nano and I haven&#8217;t missed a one. I feel pretty good about that, no matter what else happens. I crossed the 20k mark, which feels awesome. I am beginning to grok this pacing thing. Fires are smoldering inside my cranium. You can read about this, talk about this, but there is no substitute for doing. — Project: Black Mirror New words written: 1,150 Reason for stopping: End of day ![][1] — I&#8217;m facing down the fact that today is the mid-month mark and I should be 5k ahead of where I am by days end to be at parity.</p>

      <p>I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s been almost a year and a half since my Spoon! blog post, where a group of friends conspired to sent me their spoons to counteract the loss of my own thanks to newly acquired but chronic illness during a time of great life upheaval. I carried this box of carefully wrapped spoons with me everywhere. I received it in Illinois, where I was living with my Mom pre-Clarion.</p>

      <p>Yesterday was another low day, both in mood and writing. My daily target is creeping up slightly, to 1,932 words. Still within reason but I&#8217;m not happy about the lack of progress the last few days. Mostly, this comes down to November being November, and my inexperience writing at this length. This shake down cruise is not without its bumps. — Project: Black Mirror New words written: 473 Reason for stopping: End of Day ![][1] — At the same time, short fiction continues, albeit at a slower pace.</p>

      <p>Good progress today, making up for last week&#8217;s shortfall. Making bullet point outlines of character/plot has been useful in figuring out some pacing/plot arc issues and giving me things to write that I hadn&#8217;t even realized I needed. I&#8217;ll need to do a massive reverse outline come December, though. Stitching the various plots and subplots together will take some work and much rewriting. &#8212; Project: Black Mirror New words written: 2,044 Reason for stopping: End of day ![][1] &#8212; Day 13 begins anew with a writing date with my sweetheart.</p>

      <p>The last few days haven&#8217;t been the most productive ones. If I were to go by the official NaNoWriMo stats, my current estimated finish date is December 4th and I just won&#8217;t accept that. There are weekends, holidays, and writing sprints between now and then. Anything can happen. I stick to the time zone deadline pretty strictly, so I logged my numbers but kept writing and added another thousand words before bed.</p>

      <p>Winter, as they say, is coming and appropriately enough, I celebrated it with a London Fog Latte (Earl Grey tea, a shot of vanilla, and steamed milk). Not my best work here, but I laid out the bones of what needs to be done. A hot mess of potential awesome might be the best way to describe it all. I started organizing my notes for a post-Nano reverse outline. In keeping with the spirit of Nano, no words will be deleted no matter how much my inner editor cringes.</p>

      <p>Not everyone realizes that Nanowrimo, and being a writer in general, is a marathon, not a sprint. As such, I&#8217;ve given myself permission for a skip day, should I need one. I haven&#8217;t needed to call a mulligan yet but today was damn close. I went to the local coffee shop early this morning and added a third of my words. Head down and hauling ass on the day job (optimizing database queries, woo!).</p>

      <p>Doing nano during the week is the most challenging for me. I work a lot, which means I need to be even more disciplined with my time. Thanks to some work issues, I didn&#8217;t even start to think about writing until close to 7PM and I really didn&#8217;t think I was going to make it. Also, I had a bad case of the don&#8217;t wanna&#8217;s. So, I gave myself an hour break and played XBox before I got to writing.</p>

      <p>Not as much writing as I&#8217;d like today, mostly my own fault. When I actually sit down to write, I can knock out the words but today I procrastinated and was easily distracted. Still, I managed to hit parity with the Nano model of 1,667 words/day. &#8212; Project: Black Mirror New words written: 1,975 Reason for stopping: Midnight ![][1] &#8212; Almost a week in to this draft, I still feel pretty good about it.</p>
