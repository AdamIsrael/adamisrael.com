      <p>Not everyone realizes that Nanowrimo, and being a writer in general, is a marathon, not a sprint. As such, I&#8217;ve given myself permission for a skip day, should I need one. I haven&#8217;t needed to call a mulligan yet but today was damn close.
I went to the local coffee shop early this morning and added a third of my words. Head down and hauling ass on the day job (optimizing database queries, woo!</p>

      <p>Doing nano during the week is the most challenging for me. I work a lot, which means I need to be even more disciplined with my time. Thanks to some work issues, I didn&#8217;t even start to think about writing until close to 7PM and I really didn&#8217;t think I was going to make it. Also, I had a bad case of the don&#8217;t wanna&#8217;s. So, I gave myself an hour break and played XBox before I got to writing.</p>

      <p>Not as much writing as I&#8217;d like today, mostly my own fault. When I actually sit down to write, I can knock out the words but today I procrastinated and was easily distracted. Still, I managed to hit parity with the Nano model of 1,667 words/day.
&#8212;
Project: Black Mirror
New words written: 1,975
Reason for stopping: Midnight
&#8212;
Almost a week in to this draft, I still feel pretty good about it.</p>

      <p>A mostly solid day of writing. Andrea and I went out to the coffee shop for a morning session. I struggled with the words. Came home and napped.
Woke and procrastinated until the late evening and then&#8230;something broke open. Next thing I knew, I was over 2,000 words and it was almost midnight. I&#8217;m not saying they&#8217;re great words. Hell, some of them ain&#8217;t even good words. They&#8217;re my words, though, and I&#8217;m keeping them.</p>

      <p>The bad news is I am now fluent in Fluish, having spent a good chunk of the day sleeping away the sickness.
When I did bother to wake up and shake off the cobwebs, I grabbed 10 books off the shelf and started making notes. A few favorites, a few classics, a few modern contemporaries, SF and F. I looked at point of view and how each was structured. The results were interesting.</p>

      <p>I haven&#8217;t managed to get back to my usual morning schedule of writing yet. Dayjobbery filled most of the day, until I realized that the stack of tissues piling up beside me and the general malaise that I felt was part of a deeper issue. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s some weird combination of a head cold, flu, a fibro flare, or accidental glutening but I spent a chunk of the afternoon in bed and the first few hours of the evening just trying to focus.</p>

      <p>Work all day followed by a quick nap and no words before 7:30pm. Andrea kicked me out of the house and I trundled off to the coffee house, was disappointed by the lack of London Fog Tea, and sat to write.
When I&#8217;m working on a project, it takes me a few days to hit my stride. So far, so good. I did a lot better with suppressing the urge to edit and hey, I made up for yesterdays shortfall.</p>

      <p>I think I&#8217;m going to try blogging as I go &#8212; nothing extensive because I don&#8217;t want to take away from the real writing but I do want to jot down my thoughts. This is a process of learning and experimentation for me. I&#8217;ve been writing short stories seriously for four years but writing something novel-length is a different kind of beast.
One thing talked about on Twitter today was that some people actually start querying their Nano novels shortly after they&#8217;ve finished.</p>

      <p>Today is November 1st, the start of a new NaNoWriMo. I&#8217;ve been doing, or trying to do, NaNoWriMo, on and off unsuccessfully since 2002 when my efforts netted about 4,500 words.
Timing is a bitch. After I start writing seriously in 2007, I intended to do Nano that year. That November, a few days into the month, my marriage split up. The following November was the official divorce. A few slim years later, it preceded bankruptcy.</p>
