      <p>A mostly solid day of writing. Andrea and I went out to the coffee shop for a morning session. I struggled with the words. Came home and napped. Woke and procrastinated until the late evening and then&#8230;something broke open. Next thing I knew, I was over 2,000 words and it was almost midnight. I&#8217;m not saying they&#8217;re great words. Hell, some of them ain&#8217;t even good words. They&#8217;re my words, though, and I&#8217;m keeping them.</p>

      <p>The bad news is I am now fluent in Fluish, having spent a good chunk of the day sleeping away the sickness. When I did bother to wake up and shake off the cobwebs, I grabbed 10 books off the shelf and started making notes. A few favorites, a few classics, a few modern contemporaries, SF and F. I looked at point of view and how each was structured. The results were interesting.</p>

      <p>I haven&#8217;t managed to get back to my usual morning schedule of writing yet. Dayjobbery filled most of the day, until I realized that the stack of tissues piling up beside me and the general malaise that I felt was part of a deeper issue. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s some weird combination of a head cold, flu, a fibro flare, or accidental glutening but I spent a chunk of the afternoon in bed and the first few hours of the evening just trying to focus.</p>

      <p>Work all day followed by a quick nap and no words before 7:30pm. Andrea kicked me out of the house and I trundled off to the coffee house, was disappointed by the lack of London Fog Tea, and sat to write. When I&#8217;m working on a project, it takes me a few days to hit my stride. So far, so good. I did a lot better with suppressing the urge to edit and hey, I made up for yesterdays shortfall.</p>

      <p>I think I&#8217;m going to try blogging as I go &#8212; nothing extensive because I don&#8217;t want to take away from the real writing but I do want to jot down my thoughts. This is a process of learning and experimentation for me. I&#8217;ve been writing short stories seriously for four years but writing something novel-length is a different kind of beast. One thing talked about on Twitter today was that some people actually start querying their Nano novels shortly after they&#8217;ve finished.</p>

      <p>Today is November 1st, the start of a new NaNoWriMo. I&#8217;ve been doing, or trying to do, NaNoWriMo, on and off unsuccessfully since 2002 when my efforts netted about 4,500 words. Timing is a bitch. After I start writing seriously in 2007, I intended to do Nano that year. That November, a few days into the month, my marriage split up. The following November was the official divorce. A few slim years later, it preceded bankruptcy.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;ve been running slow on spoons and managing my time carefully, and I neglected to post this sooner.

Pre-orders will be available on their website November 1st, and the anthology will be released on December 15th, just in time for Christmas.

      <p>I just mailed off my first story submission since 2009. Most of my submissions are electronic but, dating back to my first submissions circa 2007, I think I&#8217;ve mailed off 5 or 6 stories or about 5% of my total submissions. Some writers don&#8217;t even own printers (John Scalzi comes to mind). Markets are evolving &#8212; not quite matching pace, but at least trailing the pack. Analog and Asimov both use the electronic submissions system developed by Neil Clarke.</p>

      <p>Fate. Destiny. The word Kismet is the Turkish word to describe something I don&#8217;t normally lend much weight to. Sometimes things happen, though. A completely random series of events that leads to something wonderful and there&#8217;s no better way to describe it. Yesterday started off kind of shitty. I was already in a bad mood, thanks to the Sunday dinner with family that ended in a bullying event by an asshole uncle-in-law that left me with back spasms, followed by a shredded tire on the borrowed truck driven by my brother-in-law that should never have been driven in the condition it was in.</p>

      <p>July 6th, 2009. That&#8217;s the date I discovered Crossed Genres. I know this because that&#8217;s the same date I submitted a story to them, and withdrew it the following day. See, I was still a very wet behind the ears writer and I was so excited about their current genre to notice that it was the previous month&#8217;s genre. Still, I had the good sense to email Bart and Kay the next day to let them know about my mistake but from that day forward I was a fan.</p>
